The Jataka narrating the story of king Vesantara who was known for his philanthropy is very popularly depicted in the art of the Indian subcontinent as well as South East Asia. According to the story the Buddha was born as king Vesantara in his previous life. Due to circumstances, he has to leave his palace along with his wife and two children and live a very modest life in the jungle where he continued his act of philanthropy. Once Jujaka, a cruel old Brahmin hearing about king Vesantara\u2019s reputation goes to him to ask for his two sons as slaves so that his young wife can have some rest. Vesantara agreed to give away his children to the Brahmin.\nThe painting shows the Brahmin Jujaka and the king Vesantara along with his two young children. The appearance of Jujaka is authentically captured by Sayed Ahmad showing Jujaka\u2019s entire ugly feature delineated by the Ajanta artist: the broken front teeth, goatee beard, the bald forehead and spiky hair at the back of his skull, the parrot-like nose and small, uncanny eyes.\nA gift from Sir Akbar Hydari.\nThe Ajanta World heritage site is comprised of numerous Buddhist rock-cut caves, embellished with thousands of square feet of mural paintings and sculptures created between the 2nd century BCE and 650 CE. The present painting is a copy of one of the mural paintings at Ajanta. It was made in the early 1920s by Sayed Ahmed. These copies were commissioned by the department of archaeology of the Hyderabad state and are considered to be the most faithful copies of the original paintings. Since most of the original paintings at Ajanta have decayed due to weather and other elements these copies became more important from the point of view of research.\nThe copies were made under the supervision of Ghulam Yazdani, an Indian archaeologist. He persuaded Nizam \u2013 the ruler of the erstwhile Hyderabad State \u2013 to allow him to document the cave paintings of Ajanta. Accordingly, the Department of Archaeology of the Hyderabad State was founded in 1915. Ghulam Yazdani became its first director. Shortly after that Yazdani gave the task of copying of murals to the artist Syed Ahmad. He was trained by a British artists Christiana Herringham and Lady Herringham to copy the frescoes with greater fidelity to the originals. Syed Ahmad achieved a high degree of success in this task of making copies as regards tone is distinctly superior to those made by previous artists like Major R. Gill (1844 \u2013 1866), John Griffiths, and Lady Herringham. During his tenure as a curator of Ajanta caves, some 3,000 paintings were created.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nARTIST\nSayed Ahmed\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nWater based pigments on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nAjanta Caves, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra","29":"A beautiful damsel\n26.4807\nDESCRIPTION\nCopy of Ajanta fresco from Cave No. I\nA beautiful damsel\n\u0932\u093e\u0935\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0924\u0940\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nARTIST\nSayed Ahmed\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nWater based pigments on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nAjanta Caves, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra","30":"A court dancer with musician\n26.4792\nDESCRIPTION\nCopy of Ajanta fresco from Cave No. I\nA court dancer with musician\n\u0926\u0930\u092c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0915 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0940\u0924\u0915\u093e\u0930\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nARTIST\nSayed Ahmed\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nWater based pigments on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nAjanta Caves, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra","31":"King, queen and attendants\n26.4789\nDESCRIPTION\nCopy of Ajanta fresco from Cave No. I\nKing, queen and attendants\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nARTIST\nSayed Ahmed\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nWater based pigments on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nAjanta Caves, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra","32":"Two Damsels\n26.4809\nDESCRIPTION\nCopy of Ajanta fresco from Cave No. I\nDetail of two damsels from the panel representing the offering of lotus flower to the Bodhisattva.\n\u2018\u092c\u094b\u0927\u093f\u0938\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u092e\u0932 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0923 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f\u2019 \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f \u0915\u093e \u090f\u0915 \u092d\u093e\u0917\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nARTIST\nSayed Ahmed\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nWater based pigments on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBombay School\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nAjanta Caves, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra","33":"My Father\n35.8\nDESCRIPTION\nThis portrait depicts the father of the artist, Jagannath Murlidhar Ahiwasi (1901-1973), Murlidhar Ahiwasi who was a well-known \u2018Haveli Kirtankar\u2019.

School of Art, he propagated this technique and popularised it among his students.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nARTIST\nGunwant Hanmanth Nagarkar (1892-1956)\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nWatercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBombay School\nTECHNIQUE\nGouache\nDATE\n20th century CE\nLOCATION\nMumbai\nDIMENSION\n--","40":"SHAKUNTALA\n31.62\nDESCRIPTION\nThis painting by Raghunath Dhondopant Dhopeshwarkar depicts Shakuntala and her companions against the scenic background.

He also worked in the then popular Bombay Revivalist Style under the guidance of the artist J. M. Ahivasi using opaque watercolours inspired by the colouring technique of Indian miniatures. During his professional life, Solegaonkar was deeply impressed by the exotic nature of the Ajanta frescoes and believed that the colours used must have belonged to the immediate environment. He made a point of collecting natural materials available around Ajanta such as coloured mud, stones, leaves, and flowers to produce similar colours.

The body is of shibuichi, an alloy of copper and silver, with applied and carved decoration showing Emma-O, the Buddhist King of Hell, dreaming of a procession of courtesans, a humorous moralistic theme which often appears on metalwork of this period. The dreaming deity is carved in high relief with details in applied copper, shakudo (an alloy of copper and gold which patinates to a luxurious black colour), and gold; the procession of the courtesans and her attendants on the reverse of the incense burner is executed in a similar technique. Exquisite panels of cloisonn\u00e9 enamel on the three legs are possibly the work of Hiratsuka Mohei or Goto Shozaburo, both of whom won prizes for their work. The finial is in the form of a humorous Oni, an ambivalent Buddhist demon, in patinated and gilt copper.\nThe vase was probably produced to order by the Ozeki Export Company of Yokohama who exhibited work at the First National Industrial Exposition in 1877 where they won prizes. Yamada Motonobu (1847\u201397), who used the art name \u201cInshi\u201d, came from a family who had served as retainers to the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family.

This was the time when artists were painting portraits of Mughal\nemperors, queens, and princes, and representations of famous architectural sites, for the markets of Delhi and Lucknow. Painters of the later Mughal school tradition at Delhi, Lucknow, Patna, and Banaras especially preferred to paint\non rectangular or oval ivory plaques which were generally used to decorate carved ebony caskets and jewellery boxes.\nIn the exhibition catalogue, George Watt refers to some exquisite paintings made by artist Muhammad Hussain Khan on ivory and paper. This artist won the silver medal for his entries, which included portraits and interiors of famous monuments at Agra, Delhi, and Amritsar. These may be the works purchased by Sir Ratan Tata that are now in the Museum. The 15 paintings on ivory consist of architectural studies of the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, the Golden Temple Amritsar, and portrait studies of Mughal begums. The paintings are done in watercolour and gold3 in the European\nmethod of \u201cwash and colour\u201d in which the colour was first dissolved in water. While using gold, the pigment was deposited at the bottom and used by painters when needed.\nThe painting of the Diwan-i-khas successfully recreates the grandeur of the special audience hall where the Mughal\nemperor Shahjahan met his courtiers and important personalities.\nThe trend of painting monuments on paper started around 1815 in Delhi with topographical drawings of local monuments. Painters worked for local patrons as well as for British officers, among them Thomas Metcalfe \u2013 a member of the Archaeological Survey of India who commissioned studies of Delhi monuments. This painting can be compared with one such watercolour painting made on paper by Muzaffar Ali Khan in c. 1840.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nARTIST\nattributed to artist Muhammad Hussain Khan\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nIvory, gold\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMughal\nTECHNIQUE\nPainting on ivory\nDATE\nearly 20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nDelhi\nDIMENSION\n11.4 x 16.6 cm","175":"Bappa Rawal worshipping Goddess Amba\n53.62\nDESCRIPTION\nScene is laid in a rocky landscape with a silvery rivulet with fish, in the foreground.

According to the story the hero Mahar falls in love with the princess Chandrabadan. When approached, Chandrabadan and her father insult him. Unable to bear the humiliation, he dies. When Chandrabadan sees the funeral procession of Mahar, her heart fills with love and repentance and she dies of shock. They are cremated together, thus being united only in death.\nThe painting is an example of continuous narration with the upper register showing the darikhana (courtroom) of Chandrabadan\u2019s father. The king is seated here against a bolster on a chowki (stool)- like throne under a chhatri (parasol). A soldier stands in front of the king with folded hands, probably informing him about Mahar\u2019s presence in the palace.\nPorcelain vases are shown in niches in the wall, a common feature of Hyderabadi paintings.\nThe lower register shows a part of the ladies\u2019 chamber where Chandrabadan is seated against a bolster, accompanied by three maids. Mahar, his lovesick eyes fixed on Chandrabadan, is shown being restrained by a soldier who looks like the one in the register above. Both the registers represent the landscape beyond the palace walls synoptically, by the tops of\nthree trees.\nThe colophon page says: \u201c8th of Safar Sana in AH 1115 in spite of illness this story was completed (by the scribe) in Farkhunda Buniyad (Hyderabad).\u201d The scribe, whose name has been blotted out, writes further that he is not hopeful of still being alive the next day but that his writing in black on white will remain alive forever. The text is written in khat e shikast (running hand).\nThere are many copies of this popular love story in other collections. There was a trend of illustrating Hindu love stories in Hyderabad.\nThe illustrations in the manuscript do not provide detailed studies of the characters or architecture. As suggested in the colophon, the manuscript seems to have been completed hurriedly for its owner without paying much attention to minute details; this and the lack of gold indicate a lesser rank of the patron of this work. The use of flat colours and the rendering\nof the female figures derive from folk painting.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nManuscript Miniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\ndated AH 1115=1707 CE\nLOCATION\nHyderabad\nDIMENSION\nFolio 22.5 x 12.8 cm, illustration 19.5 x 11 cm","177":"Portrait of an Urial\n15.282\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1st quarter of the 17th century\nLOCATION\nHyderabad\nDIMENSION\n24.7 x 35.2 cms (Folio); 18.3 x 19.4 cms painting","178":"Music Party\n22.3395\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nmid - 18th century CE\nLOCATION\nGolconda, Hyderabad\nDIMENSION\n22.4 x 13.7 cms (without border)","179":"Desakh Raga\n22.3307\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1725\nLOCATION\nHyderabad\nDIMENSION\n43.9 x 24.3 cms","180":"A Group of Nathapanthi Sages\n22.3464\nDESCRIPTION\nThis large group of sadhus (sages) in the company of devotees provides an interesting source for the study of religious sects in India. Wearing pink robes and hat-like head coverings, these sadhus belong to the Natha Sampradaya, a Shaiva sect founded by Matsyendranatha in the 8th or 9th century. Except for the landscape and the colour of the devotees\u2019 clothing, the compositions are very similar. Some of the important figures in the central group of sages can be identified because of Devanagari inscriptions next to these figures. The person in the centre, wearing a white robe and a conical cap, is identified here as Guru Gorakhnatha. The sages to his left are Raja Bhartrahari and Raja Jalandhara, and the third to his right, slightly bent, is Raja Gopichanda.\nThe painting is set in the midst of a forest where this group of Nathapanthis has decided to stay awhile. There is a small temple in the background. The group of main sadhus occupies the central space around a fire. Other members of the assembly are on their left, lower left, and top right. They are shown busy with various activities like pounding and straining bhang, a popular intoxicating Indian drink made from the hemp plant, smoking huqqa and chilam (pipe), or having a siesta. Two child sadhus, a sapera (snake charmer), a caged parrot, and dogs are also a part of the group. On the lower right a group of colourfully clothed villagers have come to pay their homage to the sages. Interestingly, a sweet-seller has put up a stall near the river in the hope of some business. A landscape with leafy and dense vegetation,\nhillocks, river with lotus flowers, and the inclusion of deer, birds, peacock, hare, and squirrel create a perfect crowded composition suited to the theme.\nThe Nathapanthis can be identified here with their typical dress code which includes choga \u2013 a terracotta-coloured\ngown, sota \u2013 wooden sticks to ward off evil spirits, and khappar \u2013 bowl consisting of a piece of a broken earthen pot. But the most distinct feature is their disk-like earrings, which they wear by tearing the earlobes. The concept behind this was that the rays of the sun should pass through the hole in the ear of the \u201cWise Brahmin\u201d. Therefore they are popularly known a kanphata (torn-ear) yogis.\nThe painting\u2019s style presents a combination of Mughal and Rajasthani with some European influence. The washes of colour and various shades of green used to show the depth and variety of vegetation are peculiar to this combined art style.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nRajasthani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nEarly 19th century CE\nLOCATION\nJaipur, Rajasthan\nDIMENSION\n45 x 33.5 cm (with border), 43 x 32.5 cm (without border)","181":"A Banquet Scene from Shahnamah\n22.3456\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPersian, Timuride\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n15th century CE\nLOCATION\n--\nDIMENSION\n33.5 x 22.3 cm (folio) 26.4x15.4cm painting without border","182":"Chandbibi hawking\n22.3440\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nLate 18th Century CE\nLOCATION\nHyderabad\nDIMENSION\n44 x 28 cms with border; 21.5 x 13.7 cms (without border)","183":"A Princess hawking\n22.3437\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nLast quarter 17th Century CE\nLOCATION\nHyderabad\nDIMENSION\n23 x 14 cms (without border)","184":"Chandbibi Hawking\n22.3435\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nLate 18th Century CE\nLOCATION\nHyderabad\nDIMENSION\n44 x 28 cms with border; 21.5 x 13.7 cms (without border)","185":"Rama Sita\n78.6\/127\nDESCRIPTION\nRama Sita\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nARTIST\nChitra Shala Press, Poona\nOBJECT TYPE\nLithograph\nMATERIAL\nPaper and ink\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nLithograph\nDATE\n20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nPune\nDIMENSION\n34 x 22.6 cms","186":"Guru Nanak\n78.6\/122\nDESCRIPTION\nGuru Nanak\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nARTIST\nChitra Shala Press, Poona\nOBJECT TYPE\nLithograph\nMATERIAL\nPaper and ink\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nLithograph\nDATE\n20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nPune\nDIMENSION\n35.6 x 22.5 cms","187":"Gajendra-Moksha\n78.6\/118\nDESCRIPTION\nGajendra-Moksha\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nARTIST\nChitra Shala Press, Poona\nOBJECT TYPE\nLithograph\nMATERIAL\nPaper and ink\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nLithograph\nDATE\n20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nPune\nDIMENSION\n33 x 22 cms","188":"Rana Pratap\n78.6\/42\nDESCRIPTION\nRana Pratap\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nOBJECT TYPE\nLithograph\nMATERIAL\npaper and ink\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nLithograph\nDATE\n20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nPune\nDIMENSION\n47 x 34 cms","189":"Savitri\n78.6\/28\nDESCRIPTION\nSavitri (Madhyana Sandhya)\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nARTIST\nChitra Shala Press, Poona\nOBJECT TYPE\nLithograph\nMATERIAL\npaper and ink\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nLithograph\nDATE\n20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nPune\nDIMENSION\n47.2 x 30.2 cms","190":"Jhashichi Rani Lakshmibai\n78.6\/22\nDESCRIPTION\nJhashichi Rani Lakshmibai (Queen Lakshmibai of Jhansi)\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nARTIST\nChitra Shala Press, Poona\nOBJECT TYPE\nLithograph\nMATERIAL\npaper and ink\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nLithograph\nDATE\n20th Century CE\nLOCATION\nPune\nDIMENSION\n47 x 34 cms","191":"The Raven\n2015.132\nDESCRIPTION\nGift of Mrs. Shirin Sabavala\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBombay School\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n2010\nLOCATION\nMumbai\nDIMENSION\n--","192":"The Eye\n2015.131\nDESCRIPTION\nGift of Mrs. Shirin Sabavala\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBombay School\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n2010\nLOCATION\nMumbai\nDIMENSION\n--","193":"The Brown Landscape\n2015.128\nDESCRIPTION\nGift of Mrs. Shirin Sabavala\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBombay School\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n2010\nLOCATION\nMumbai\nDIMENSION\n--","194":"The Cobras\n2015.133\nDESCRIPTION\nGift of Mrs. Shirin Sabavala\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBombay School\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n2010\nLOCATION\nMumbai\nDIMENSION\n--","195":"An Unfinished Landscape\n2015.130\nDESCRIPTION\nThe artist\u2019s studio has never been a stable, self-consistent space.

The Rajatarangini of Kalhana records that King Jayapida founded the city of Jayapura, identified by Buhler as Andarkot, situated on the Sambar lake. He built many temples and viharas there. Referring to the installation of Chaturatmana Vishnu it states, \u201cIn his own town (of Jayapura) Keshava, showing his quadruple form (Chaturatmana) as well as reclining on the Sesha, has truly taken up his abode, abandoning his residence in Vishnuloka (i.e. Vaikuntha)\u201d.\nThe idol of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti has become very popular in Kashmir after this as evidenced by a number of icons of this deity belonging to the 8th\u201310th centuries from this region.\nThe four faces of Vaikuntha symbolise the Pancharatra concept of four vyuhas. The central human face with long curved eyebrows and closed meditative eyes represents Vasudeva, to its left is the face of Varaha representing Samkarshana and to its right is that of the lion representing Pradyumna. Both these have partially open mouths exposing their teeth and have wide round eyes. All three are adorned with earrings, with crown and other decorations on their heads.

Once when Parvati, the consort of Shiva, went to bathe in the river Ganga, all the gods prayed to her to protect them from the powerful\ndemons Shumbha and Nishumbha.

Kaushiki, the goddess of ethereal beauty, who has just emerged from Parvati, stands there exchanging a word with her, watched by the gods.\nThe most significant features of the painting are the far hillsides with wavy rims on pale edges, and the special type of female form with sensuous curves, tenderly rounded breasts, and dignified stance. The goddess has long black strands of hair, a rounded bun at the back, and serene demeanour. The stark bare background acts as a foil to her feminine grace.\nThe series of Markandeya Purana to which this painting belongs, is a noteworthy example of pre-Kangra art which can be ascribed safely to Guler.

The episode is described in the Aranyakanda of the Ramayana (Chapter 5). Rama and Sita are seated on a platform under a tree while Lakshmana sits on a platform opposite. The tall demoness Surpanakha disguised as a beautiful lady is trying to convince Rama to leave Sita and take her instead as his wife. She tries to\nwin him with promises of comfort and luxury. She is adorned with various ornaments and stands before Rama respectfully, head covered with her odhani. Her gesture is indicative of her address to Rama.\nThe painting is more symbolic than realistic in its representation of the Ramayana. Usually the exiled group is shown clad in tribal or ascetic attire in the forest but here the artist has depicted them in fully royal dress. Moreover, clearly he has portrayed the demoness as a proportionately larger figure than the three protagonists. The separation of Lakshmana from Rama and Sita is also unusual. Thus either the artist was not familiar with usual Ramayana illustration or he was determined to give his own psychological interpretation of the episode.\nAlthough the picture was rendered in the Deccan, its style differs from normal Deccani style and seems to follow the less flamboyant and flatter Rajput mode of expression, seen also in other series of paintings done for Hindu patrons. The simple, formal composition and the narrative strategy make this a fascinating work.\nKarl and Meherbai Khandalavala Collection\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc 1640\u201350\nLOCATION\nAurangabad, Maharashtra\nDIMENSION\n16.5 x 19 cm (with border), 14.2 x 17.2 cm (without border).","285":"Rani Balauria\n2009.126\nDESCRIPTION\nInscription in old Takri on the reverse: Sri Rani Valauri di Surati The likeness of the exalted Balauria Queen\nIn the portrait of Rani Balauria we have a miniature of quite unusual interest. The queen appears to be a young girl of about eighteen, and assuming she was twelve at the time of her marriage in 1759, the most likely date for the present\npainting would be circa 1765. In any event, the painting cannot, on stylistic grounds, be assigned to a period later than the third quarter of the 18th century, and accordingly the inscription must refer to Amrit Pal\u2019s queen. It should be noted that a\nconcession to the orthodox Basohli kalam has been made in the use of the broad red borders which surround the miniature. The background is uncoloured. The queen herself, however, is dressed in the Mughal manner, and affects the yellow and purple turban which was in vogue at the Imperial capitals amongst ladies of rank during the 18th century. Standard types seen in the painting were much favoured in Guler during Prakash Chand\u2019s reign (1773\u201390).\nThe painting is unfinished, but the old Takri inscription thereon is obviously contemporary. It seems to have been a common practice to write inscriptions on paintings before they were completed. These inscriptions probably served the\npurpose of an identification tag when the artists had several pictures in hand at the same time and were being aided by family members or pupils in their completion.\nKarl & Meherbai Khandalavala Collection\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nARTIST\nattributed to Manaku\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari school\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\ncirca 1765\nLOCATION\nGuler\nDIMENSION\n19.4 x 13.3 cm (with border), 16.1 x 10.8 cm (without border)","286":"Krishna and Gopas Playing the Game of Hide and Seek\n2009.12\nDESCRIPTION\nAs Krishna grew up, he attended to the herds like any other village lad and, in the woodland where the cattle grazed, he and his companions played Blindman\u2019s Buff or Hide and Seek or some other boyish game.\nThe headgear of the cowherds consists of a pointed cap (kulah) around which is tied a decorated sash (pechi) with loose ends. Krishna and his brother Balarama frequently wear this costume when tending the cows with their companions or while engaged in sport. When worn by Krishna and Balarama, the cap is surmounted with peacock feathers.\nThe delineation of a forest grove by a circle of trees occupies the main picture space. The dramatis personae are placed within this circle. There is marked stylization of tree forms. Among the two usual forms, the first is a tree which has the\nappearance of a circular, many-petalled, dahlia. It has either a short thick trunk or a long narrow stem.

They all wear matted locks and beards and a scanty piece of cloth tied at the waist to cover them.\nHis mount, the swan also faces him with a raised beak as if joining the group in adoration of Brahma. The adoring figures rhythmically converge into the central figure of Brahma seated erect in perfect poise and serenity. His usual emblems akshamala, shruva and kamandalu are held by him in his three hands, whereas the fourth one is in the varadamudra. He is adorned with beautiful and intricately carved ornaments including the mrigacharma on his left shoulder. The treatment of clouds is particularly imaginative and the artist has succeeded in creating a sense of dimension even in this low relief.\nThe panel is bordered with a floral scroll similar to that of the image of Sheshashayi, indicating that these two were probably placed in the same row.\nCOLLECTION\nSculptures\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nPink Sandstone\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n7th century CE\nLOCATION\nAihole, Bijapur District, Karnataka\nDIMENSION\n125 x 220.5 cms.","342":"KAUMARI\nS 66.56\nDESCRIPTION\nTHOUGH in the early period Kaumari appears as an individual goddess, she is assimilated with the Saptamatrika group\u2013 the group of seven goddeses\u2013 when it is standardised in the 3rd century CE. However, till the 6th century CE she continues to enjoy her position as an individual goddess as is evident from outstanding 6th century sculptures of Kaumari from Shamalaji and Parel. These mother goddesses were believed to be malevolent spirits who would inflict the children with diseases if they were annoyed. According to a legend narrated in the Vanaparvan of the Mahabharata, Skanda-Kartikeya converted these malevolent female spirits into benign mother goddesses.\nGoddess Kaumari, in this image, is seated in a variation of Lalitasana holding a fruit in her right hand. One end of the long spear held in her left hand is supported on the ground. She wears a kuchabandha around her full breasts, while her lower garment is indicated by incised folds on the legs. Moderately bedecked, her ornaments consist of a beaded necklace, armlets and Chakrakundala.

As mentioned in the Divyavadana and other later texts, female guards were employed by the kings. A.S. Altekar has referred to several examples of the female guards and stated that the Karnatak women were particularly known for this. The image was earlier identified as the chauri bearer by the scholars. However, the long club on which her hand is supported and her personality both suggest her role as a guard. The identification was confirmed by Anand Krishna in a personal discussion. Her top-heavy body is slightly stretched as she stands in attention, looking straight with her wide-open eyes. Her facial features, particularly the thick lips, and her bust are very different from the physical features of Indian women.

He was born in 1776 to a wealthy mill owner in Suffolk, and against his family\u2019s wishes, he was admitted to the Royal Academy in 1800. Throughout his life, he focused on painting the landscapes surrounding his home in East Bergholt. His renowned works include Wivenhoe Park, Dedham Vale, and The Hay Wain.\nConstable had a rebellious approach to his art. He had a deep appreciation of the interplay of light and the ever-changing patterns of clouds. Rather than conforming to expected idealisations, he aimed for accurate representations of nature. He drew inspiration from the work of Thomas Gainsborough (1772\u20131788), another Suffolk resident, whom he greatly admired.\nConstable\u2019s dedication to capturing the essence of the natural world had a profound impact on the development of landscape painting. His attention to detail, and his ability to convey the effects of light and atmosphere, set him apart as an exceptional artist. His works captured the romantic beauty of the English countryside, resonating with viewers and inspiring future generations of artists.\n\nSir D. J.

It depicts the wise and beautiful Abigail offering David a gift of copious goods, which her churlish husband Nabal had denied him, specifically the moments in verses 23 and 27: \u201cAnd when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David.\u2026 And [she said] now this present which thy servant hath brought, unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.\u201d When Nabal learned of his wife\u2019s furtive deed, \u201chis heart died within him\u201d, freeing her to marry David.\nThe artist of this large painting almost certainly is Erasmus Quellinus II (1607\u2013 78), a well-educated Flemish painter and draughtsman who joined the artists\u2019 guild in Antwerp in 1632.1 During the 1630s he was an important collaborator of Peter Paul Rubens, whose work had a profound influence on his own style. Following Rubens\u2019 death in 1640, he became the official painter of Antwerp. Wealthy at the time of his death, he owned paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck, and other prominent artists, as well as many sculptures, prints, and drawings.\nLike Quellinus II\u2019s 'Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau and Jephta Greeted by his Daughter', which share many features with\nDavid and Abigail, the Tata canvas probably was painted during the earlier 1630s. All three reflect the design and sumptuous staging of a 'David and Abigail' executed in Rubens\u2019 studio a decade earlier (J. Paul Getty Museum).

A companion canvas depicted \u201cBacchus and Ariadne reclining on a bank, surrounded by satyrs and nymphs\u201d. Both were consigned by Sir Henry Oxenden and were bought by George Yates. Bacchus and Ariadne are unidentified; the history of Homer, Apollo and the Muses between 1839 and Sir Ratan\u2019s acquisition of it remains untraced.\nWhat Christie\u2019s had wrong, however, was the artist, whom they identified as the great French painter Nicolas Poussin (as\nsuch it has remained in the Museum\u2019s records). Homer, Apollo and the Muses are by Mattia Preti instead, a gifted artist from the south of Italy whose prolific career began in Rome (1630s\u201340s), flourished in Naples (1653\u201360), and concluded with a long sojourn on Malta (1661\u201399). That Poussin\u2019s name could be attached to this painting points to its date around 1640 when Preti was moving away from a Caravaggesque phase to one that embraced neo-Venetian trends as exemplified in Poussin\u2019s art. The low vantage point of Homer, Apollo and the Muses and its literary subject suggests that it could have decorated the ceiling of a library.

The subject fits a set of five mythological\nscenes celebrating wine and love, commissioned by Duke Alfonso d\u2019Este to decorate a camerino in his castle in Ferrara.\nGiovanni Bellini\u2019s Feast of the Gods was completed first, by 1514, followed by three of Titian\u2019s greatest secular works: the Worship of Venus, Bacchanal of the Andrians, and Bacchus and Ariadne. The group was completed by the local court artist, Dosso Dossi, with a scene described by the Renaissance historian Giorgio Vasari as \u201ca Bacchanal rout of men which was so good, that, even if he had never done any other thing, for that alone [Dosso] would deserve praise and the name of an excellent painter\u201d.\nThe Duke\u2019s camerino is destroyed and Dosso\u2019s Bacchanal unidentified \u2013 at least until 2000, when this painting, acquired by Sir Ratan shortly after it was sold in 1917 as \u201cDosso Dossi (School of)\u201d, was put forward as the long-lost picture. It almost certainly is by the same hand as an altarpiece from the church of Santa Maria in Vado in Ferrara, which belongs to a group of paintings claimed to be Dosso\u2019s early work. Most scholars, however, reject the claim on stylistic grounds. Moreover, to accept them would mean that the Tata painting, despite its apparently derivative correspondences with Titian\u2019s Bacchus and Ariadne, pre-dates that masterpiece by nearly a decade. Thus it seems unlikely that this could be Dosso\u2019s painting from the camerino.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nEuropean Paintings\nARTIST\nAttributed to Dosso Dossi (c. 1486\u2013 1541\/42)\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nRenaissance\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n16th century CE\nLOCATION\nItaly\nDIMENSION\n136 x 168.5 cm","400":"The Sword of Damocles\n22.4544\nDESCRIPTION\nWhen this painting was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1804, Dubost won the praise of Jacques-Louis David and a gold medal from Napoleon.It depicts the 4th century BCE tyrant Damocles surrounded by dancing girls and objects of luxury as he espies a sword precariously suspended above him, thereby realizing that with perpetual menace there can be no happiness. The dramatic, academic nude is fully Davidian, while its languorous pose, coyly veiled genitals, and attenuated leg partake in a fashion of the time to evoke androgyny.\nDubost took the painting to London where, in 1807, The Times declared it \u201cone of the richest pictures we ever beheld\u201d. It caught the attention of Thomas Hope, the Dutch-born merchant banker, collector, designer, and promoter of the Greek Revival. (Lawrence\u2019s portrait, is of his younger brother.) He bought it for 800 guineas but infuriated Dubost by overpainting some areas and cutting the canvas down at the top in order to make it fit a symmetrical hang in his London town house. He even effaced the artist\u2019s signature when Dubost\u2019s detractors claimed that it was too good to have been painted by Dubost and must be by David instead. Dubost retaliated with a satirical painting of Beauty and the Beast, giving the beast Hope\u2019s likeness. Hope\u2019s brother-in-law slashed it to pieces, Dubost sued for damages, and he published a booklet exposing Hope as \u201cmore of the Dutch trader than the liberal patron.\nDespite its quality and having been the focus of so much attention, by the time of the Hope auction in 1917. The Sword of Damocles had lost its attribution and sold for only \u00a357-15-0 as \u201cFrench School\u201d.

Despite patronage from Europe\u2019s heads of state and the English aristocracy, and despite becoming President of the Royal Academy (1820), Lawrence was habitually in debt, chiefly because of his extravagant lifestyle, including the cost of amassing an unrivalled collection of Old Master prints and drawings. Pressed to produce (he was near bankruptcy in 1807), he took on more commissions than he and his assistants could complete. When Sir Ratan paid 525 guineas for this portrait at the Hope auction in 1917, he almost certainly was unaware that it had remained in Lawrence\u2019s studio after the artist died, along with some 150 other unfinished portraits. It was only \u201cabt 1\/2 finished\u201d and completed by another hand, perhaps that of the Irish painter Sir Martin Archer Shee.\nLawrence\u2019s most dramatic full-length portraits have a low point of view silhouetting and enhancing their towering figures. Exemplary is his Portrait of John Philip Kemble, as Coriolanus (1798), which conceptually is akin to his Portrait of Henry Philip Hope.Henry Philip (1774\u20131839) was a younger brother of the more famous collector and taste-maker Thomas Hope , who in 1798 had been painted by William Beechey in Ottoman costume, turbaned and with dagger in hand. Henry Philip sat for Lawrence in 1805, likewise dressed in Ottoman style to evoke his travels and admiration of Greek civilization.

The meaning is clear: the young girl is confronting the dilemma of deciding between a religious and a secular life.

In design and style his paintings are conservative, variations more than advances on models by the great Venetian masters. Although he ran a busy workshop (Jacopo Bassano studied under him), he seldom attracted high patronage or top fees. He and his collaborators spent some 20 years decorating the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi at the Rialto, all the while producing numerous private devotional and secular paintings.\nAmong those, the Adoration of the Magi was a particularly popular subject in the artist\u2019s studio, where many versions with compositional variations were recycled. In the Tata painting, for instance, the pose of the central standing magus (who might contain a contemporary portrait) simply reverses his counterpart in Bonifazio\u2019s Adoration at Petworth House; the turbaned magus at the right closely echoes a kindred figure in an Adoration of 1537 in the Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia in Venice; and the posture of the Virgin in effect repeats her position in still two more Adorations in the same museum. All three of those paintings in the Accademia have been catalogued as studio productions, one of which is even dated 1558, three years after the artist\u2019s death.\nSir D.J.

It is likely that the use of conch shells introduced in the mountainous regions of Tibet from India where it is available in plenty and is ascribed symbolic significance of purity of primordial sound. The sound of the conch shell trumpet from the roof of a monastery is a call sign for the Lamas.\nWhen used as a trumpet, it is heavily decorated. The conch is attached to the trumpet which has a rectangular metal plate. Often the designs on these are gold plated. The conch shell with the right turned whorls is considered highly auspicious, so much so that one such trumpet was taken by a Tibetan emissary De-bzhin-gshegs-pa to China as an offering to the King Chengzu in 1407 CE.\nThe trumpet is attached to a shell and has a decorative brass plate soldered to it.

It is believed that originally the valley was a lake and it was Manjusri who cut a path with his sword\nand created the Chaubar gorge in the south through which the water escaped to leave behind the verdant fertile land. His popularity can also be accounted for due to his role as the embodiment of wisdom and knowledge without which enlightenment is not possible.\nIn this metal image, he is represented as a princely youthful figure seated in the meditative posture known as vajraparyanka with feet placed on the thighs. He has four arms, two of the hands clearly holding the sword and the manuscript of the Prajnaparamita text. The other two would have held an arrow on the right and a bow on the left. While the sword symbolizes the cutting of the knots of ignorance, the book needs little explanation. The bow and arrow made of flowers are of course the attributes of the god of desire Kamadeva with whom Manjusri is identified. One of his synonyms is Vajrananga, Ananga being an epithet of Kama. In a number of descriptions Manjusri is said to display the flavour or mood of love (shringara rasa).\nAs Vajrananga he is imprecated in spells to bewitch women.\nLikely here the bodhisattva is portrayed in the form known as Arapachana Manjusri since he presides over a group of five deities that originate from the five syllables a, ra, pa, cha, na. His popularity is evinced by the fact that the circa 12th century Sanskrit compendium of meditational visualizations (dhyana or sadhana) known as the Sadhanamala includes eight examples, though none describes him with four arms.\nKarl and Meherbai Khandalavala Collection\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine religious object\nMATERIAL\nGilt bronze\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc 1700\nLOCATION\nNepal\nDIMENSION\n18.5 cm","413":"Bhaishajyaguru\n33.743\nDESCRIPTION\nBuddha as the Lord of Medicine\nThe Buddha is seated in padmasana (lotus pose) holding a myrobalan in his right hand resting on his knee, while his left hand, which rests in his lap, supports a pot. He wears a samghati (upper garment) with a bold incised border over his left shoulder falling at the back in an unusual pattern. His elongated earlobes touch the shoulders. He has a prominent urna (tuft of hair between the eyebrows). His hair done in sharp curled ringlets rises into a three-tiered ushnisha (cranial protuberance) with a bud-shaped chintamani (wisdom jewel) above. His hair is secured with a headband with knots tied over the ears and tassels falling on both sides. His lotus seat is modeled only frontally; the rear was left plain for a possible inscription.\nIn Sanskrit, the term bhaishajya meaning healing, takes its root from bhishaj, to cure. In the Vedic mythology the celestial twins, Ashvinikumars, are the physicians of the gods. In Buddhism, aside from its physical aspect, healing also relates metaphorically to spiritual awakening. Bhaishajyaguru symbolizes Sakyamuni\u2019s ability to heal the body as well as dispel the spirit of darkness. The concept is embodied in the Bhaishajyaguru Sutra which was first translated into Chinese by Srimitra around 317\u2013322 CE, and later re-translated into Tibetan. The Sutra acknowledges seven Medicine Buddhas. However, in Tibet, Bhaishajyaguru with his own seven brothers is joined by Sakyamuni, making a group of nine. But they are rare as a group either in sculpture or painting in Tibet.\nBasically, the image of Sakyamuni was modified by assigning the attribute of the myrobalan fruit, an important ingredient in Indian pharmacopia, to create images of the Healing Buddha. Further iconographic developments took place in Central Asia through which the cult of Bhaishajyaguru travelled to East Asia and Tibet.\nSir D.J.

A well-known Buddhist monk Rinchen Sangpo (958\u20131055 CE) visited the university of Vikramashila on invitation from Atisa. When Rinchen Sangpo returned to Tibet he took with him several Kashmiri artists to work for the monasteries there. The artists worked together with the Tibetan craftsmen and created several monasteries, temples, sculptures and paintings, such as monasteries of Tobo, Tholing, Tsaparang and Alchi, to name a few. The Kashmiri artists left a definite influence on the art of Tibet giving rise to a new idiom, the combination of Tibetan and Kashmiri styles, during the 11th\u201312th century CE.

The image was once a part of the Li Gotami collection who had copied the Tsaparang frescoes and presented some to this museum.\nThe clay sculptures formed an important part of the monasteries and temples of western Tibet and the Ladakh region during the 10th\u201313th century. Shilpashastras and Puranas consider clay as one of the suitable materials for making sculptures. The tradition was prevalent in India, Ceylon, Central Asia and China. For the bigger sculptures, wooden armatures were used. Then a thick coat of clay mixed with straw was applied. To get a smoother surface, layers of wool or fine straw were added. The finer surface was achieved by the final coat of very fine clay. The body was then given shape and ornamented. Finally it was given a coat of paint. The present image is made of fine clay with the straw filling inside.\nThe position of the image obviously indicates it to be a part of the Yab-Yum image, the male counterpart of which is now missing. Even though it is just a small remnant of the image, the face vibrates with the ecstasy of orgasmic bliss. The stylistic features, a particularly elongated torso, and the modelling of her long face bear the imprint of some of the characteristics of the art of Kashmir. It is no wonder, as Tsaparang was in close contact with Kashmir during this time, through the great master Padmasambhava or Rinchen Sangpo as discussed earlier.

These energies or shaktis were identified as emanations of the goddess Durga and could be reabsorbed into her body\nat will.\nThe present image shows the deity seated in lalitasana. Her right foot is resting on a small lotus-shaped footrest. This four-armed goddess is holding a kapala, khadg and gada. Her natural left hand is in the abhaya mudra. The position of thumb and third finger suggests a rosary held in her hand.\nShe wears a dhoti with floral designs and leaf-patterned border. The upper garment covering her full breasts passes over the left shoulder and elegantly falls behind her. Represented as a young and slim woman of enchanting beauty, she wears a necklace, urahsutra, chakra-kundalas, armlet and anklets. Most of them are studded with semiprecious stones, showing a north-east Indian influence on the early Malla bronzes. She is wearing a three-pointed crown with fan-like side projections, generally seen in the Pala bronzes.\nA very interesting feature of this bronze is the hairstyle. Her hair is tied into a big bun decorated with seven strings of pearls. This type of hairstyle is frequently shown in the art of Ajanta, Ellora and Aurangabad of the Vakataka and post-Vakataka phase.\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine\nMATERIAL\nGilt Bronze\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n14th century CE\nLOCATION\nNepal\nDIMENSION\n18.5 x 12.5 x 13.5 cms.","428":"Indra\n22.1392\nDESCRIPTION\nThe elegantly modelled god sits in maharajalilasana \u2013 the posture of royal ease. His left hand, holding the stalk of a lotus which rises above his shoulder, rests on his seat balancing the inclination of his body. On the bloom is the vajra or thunderbolt. His outstretched right hand, in gajahasta (elephant trunk gesture), rests on his raised right knee. The diminutive figure is richly ornamented with necklaces, yajnopavita (sacred thread), and a waistband with an interesting medallion clasp. The ornamental plates covering his legs look more like armour plates. A scarf, separately attached to the image, falls in a loop behind his neck and left hand. The lotus-petalled prabhavali (aureole) symbolizes his divine status.\nSeveral features distinguish this Nepali image of Indra. One is the third eye placed horizontally across the forehead. Indra was cursed with having a thousand sores on his body which were later converted into eyes. Usually only one is shown in sculptures and it is delineated on the forehead like a normal eye, unlike the vertical third eye of Shiva. Second, the type of crown seen here is restricted to images of Indra and to Nepal \u2013 with antecedents in the art of Gandhara. Third, in Nepali images, Indra is generally seated in the pose of royal ease, which is appropriate for the king of the gods, but not encountered in India. Finally, he is the great wielder of the thunderbolt which is as old as the Vedic mythology.\nIndra was one of the most important Vedic deities who destroyed the asuras, the demon enemies of the gods. He was also invoked for favours, including sending rains. In the later Hindu pantheon he was demoted to the position of guardian deity of the easterly direction (one of the ashtadikpalas); however he takes precedence in this group. His Vedic role as god of the rains continues to be remembered in Nepal where the annual festival of Indra \u2013 Indrayatra \u2013 is a national festival. It incorporates the more ancient Indo-European cosmic pillar cult.\nIn Buddhist mythology, Indra is credited with medicinal-healing qualities including as a remover of barrenness in women.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine\nMATERIAL\nGilt bronze set in turquoise\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc. 18th century CE\nLOCATION\nTibet\nDIMENSION\n12.9 x 11 x 4.8 cm","429":"Shrine\n22.2964\nDESCRIPTION\nShrine with stand below supported by Garudas on four sides.

He is accompanied by his mount Garuda and consort Sridevi.\nThe mandala illustrates different aspects of Vishnu incorporated in the pantheon. The Panchratra concept of four vyuhas of Vishnu namely Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are depicted in the next circle. The ensuing circle shows eight figures holding a lotus who can be interpreted either as ashtanagas or eight vasus. The last or outermost circle depicts fourteen incarnations of Vishnu while the four corners are occupied by Vishnu, Ganapati, Mahakala and Devi. In the outer side of the square are rendered Navgrahas, Ashtadikpalas, Brahma, Bhairava, Indra, Kubera, Mahakala, Dvarapalas and other minor divinities.\nThe lower row at the top of the mandala illustrates multi-armed Vishnu flanked by twelve emanations or sub-vyuhas, while the upper row is occupied by the Dashavataras of Vishnu.\nThe inscriptions in the Newari script on the pata says that this Vishnu pata was meant to commemorate the event of Anantavrata by the king of Bhatgaon Sumatijayajitamitramalla. At the base of the painting, in the left corner, the king is seen performing the vrata in the presence of his priest and the family members, identified by the names written above their heads. The lower right corner of the pata shows some dignitaries of his court.\nThe king is known by the name Jitamitra Malla, who reigned for twenty one years. An ardent devotee of Vishnu, he is known to have built many monuments including a Dharamshala with the temples of Narayana in 1682 CE. Jagatprakash Malla, the father of Jayajitamitramalla, erected a Garuda pillar at Narayana Chowk.\nThe inscription at the spot says \u201cShri Jaya Jagatprakasha Malla Raja, the master of many arts and sciences, composed hymns in honour of Garuda-dhwaja for the benefit of the people\u2026\u201d This fact explains the unusual importance given to Garuda in this pata by depicting him six-armed. In the middle there is a dancing figure of Mahakala holding a flywhisk in both hands, flanked by musicians.\nAnantavrata is a rite performed to propitiate Vishnu and is observed for fourteen years after which udyapana (literally dismantling the installation of the deity) is done. It is observed on the Ananta-Chaturdasi day, that is on the 14th day of the brighter half of Bhadrapada (August-September). According to a popular legend, Krishna suggested to the Pandavas to observe the wish-fulfilling Anantavrata during their period of exile to regain their power. The vrata gained popularity in Nepal during the last few centuries and such patas or paintings were consecrated at the time of udyapana of the vrata.\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nCloth\nMATERIAL\npainting on cloth\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nDated N.S. 806 =1686 CE\nLOCATION\nNepal\nDIMENSION\n73 x 116 cms.","434":"LEGENDS OF LOKESHVARA\n55.63\nDESCRIPTION\nThis particular scroll depicts the story of Red Machhendranatha popularly known as Bunga or the Lokeshvara in Nepal. According to the inscription on the scroll, it was donated by Shri Kashiraj Bharo of Byam Vihara, in the year 737 N.S.= 1617 CE on the occasion of the Rathayatra ceremony of Lokeshvara, the popular deity of Nepal. This festival of Rathayatra, celebrated in the month of April or early May, is attended by almost everybody with equal zeal and faith.\nDuring the reign of King Narendradeva of Bhaktapur (740\u2013777 CE), as the story relates, the valley of Kathmandu was experiencing the worst famine causing heavy loss of life for a period of over 12 years.\nGorakhanatha, with the intention of punishing the people for not giving him due respect and also with the thought that knowing people\u2019s misery and sorrow, Machhendranatha, his Guru would appear in person, had imprisoned the valley\u2019s rain-giving snake. Bandhudatta, the learned priest of the king started to fetch Lord Machhendranatha, youngest son of demon Shashi who ruled Assam. Because of the powerful recitation of the mantras, Machhendranatha transformed into a large black bee and flew into the golden ceremonial vase of Bandhudatta.\nOn the way back, they stopped near the river Nakhu, two miles south of Patan, to rest, where Gorakhanatha, who was residing on the top of the hillock, came to pay homage to his Guru, releasing the rain-giving gods. People rejoiced as it rained heavily. The sacred vessel was enshrined and a beautiful temple was then constructed in Patan. A mammoth festival was held in which the image of Macchendranatha was carried in a chariot around the streets of Patan. In keeping with the time-honoured tradition, the same practice is followed even today.\nIn the painting, the story runs from left to right. In the upper register, the king\u2019s consultation with the spiritual guide Bandhudatta and the trial with the demons to bring Macchendranatha is shown. The second register depicts a hillock where Gorakhanatha used to reside, and the scenes related to the rescue of the rain-giving snake gods and the consecration of Machhendranatha in the temple. The third panel details the actual Rathayatra festival when Lokeshvara after being given a bath and performing other rituals, is placed inside the massive chariot. The donor is shown performing yajna in the presence of Vajracharya.\nThe scroll is a typical example of continuous narration. At some places, scenes are bifurcated with simple lines, architectural panels, or vegetations, and at others, various episodes run without putting any rigid partition, but by only suggesting it with the position of figures standing or sitting back to back. Each episode is set against the backdrop of a screen, decorated with floral and creeper designs. This is an early stylistic trait derived from the monastic style of painting. Draughtsmanship is bold but effective. The painting is done mainly in red, ochre and blue colours.\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nCloth Painting\nMATERIAL\nCloth Painting\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nDated N.S. 737 = 1617 CE\nLOCATION\nNepal\nDIMENSION\n252.8 x 66.2 cms.","435":"FOLIOS FROM AN ILLUSTRATED MANUSCRIPT OF DEVI MAHATMYA\n56.45\nDESCRIPTION\nTHE artistic traditions which migrated to Nepal from eastern India included the production of palm leaf manuscripts with illustrations painted on them. Even though palm leaf is not an indigenous product of Nepal, the tradition must have survived on imports most probably from India itself. However the painting style which evolved on their manuscripts remained typically Nepalese.\nThis manuscript, datable to c. 1400 CE is one of the earliest Devi Mahatmya illustrated manuscripts from Nepal. Devi Mahatmya, originally a part of the Markandeya Purana, was very popular in Nepal from where a number of illustrated manuscripts of the text have been found.\nAs referred to earlier, the text mainly describes the fight between the goddess Durga and Mahishasura and other demons who were destroyed by her. This Museum has in all 46 folios of the manuscript out of which eight are illustrated. The wooden covers of the manuscript are also illuminated on the outer sides. The folios are decorated with floral borders whereas the main illustrations correspond to the text and mostly depict Durga in different forms in combat with the demons. The illustrations cover almost all the important episodes from the myth.\nThese eight folios are :\n1. Rishi Markandeya the main reciter of the Mahatmya, after whom this Purana is named, narrates the story to his disciple Kraushtuki Bhaguri. The ascetic is shown in his hoary form, whereas the disciple, with hands in the vitaraka mudra, is shown as a divine figure.\n2. It relates to the first chapter of Devi Mahatmya where sage Medha narrates the Mahatmya of the great goddess Mahamaya to King Sumedha and Vaishya Samadhi.\n3. Destruction of the Asuras Madhu and Kaitabha. Though there is a suggestive arched architectural band used as a base in other folios, the goddess here is shown standing on a river bed. The river is depicted with wavy patterns along with fish and molasses in their shells.\n4. The goddess is killing the demon Mahishasura. This is a high point in the narrative of Devi and is most frequently depicted in art. As described in the text, the ten-armed Devi suppresses with all her strength, the demon emerging out of the body of Mahisha (buffalo), holding his tail by one hand. Her left foot is firmly placed on him while the right one is on her vehicle.\n5. Kali, destroying Chanda and Munda in another folio.\n6. Kali is killing the demon Raktabija. He is depicted twice here, once on the ground in blue colour, and secondly, when he was lifted up by Devi on her spear, shown in red colour.\n7. The seventh folio depicts the killing of Shumbha.\n8. Gods paying homage to the goddess.\nThe first two folios published here show ascetic Markandeya and Medha. The other three folios depict the killing of Chanda-Munda, Shumbha and visit of gods to Devi.\nThe two wooden covers are illustrated with the images of Shiva dancing on the bull, Mahishasuramardini, Kali, seven matrikas, Mahalakshmi and Ganesha.\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nManuscript\nMATERIAL\nPalm leaf\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n14th century CE\nLOCATION\nNepal\nDIMENSION\n34 x 5.8 cms.","436":"A Lama\n33.1063\nDESCRIPTION\nThe thangka illustrates a grand lama of the Gelugpa sect identified by the conical yellow cap worn by him. He is seated in Padmasana on a decorated throne in the middle while the surrounding area narrates important episodes from his life. Seated straight in Padmasana, wearing a red sanghati made of 25 pieces of cloth with floral designs all over, he holds a pot containing the water of life in his left hand placed on his lap. Several ritual objects are placed in front of him on the table such as white chorten, symbol of the spread of Buddhism, incense burner, bell, scarf and a box.\nInscriptions identify the locations of the scenes around the lama. Right above him, in between the sun and moon, is the Tushita heaven, the seventh heaven and the final destination of the enlightened Buddhist souls. To its right, near the sun is the Copper Mountain Paradise and beyond it is Chamara Dvipa. To the left of the Tushita heaven are Sukhavati Paradise and Vajradakini Paradise. The remaining locations show monasteries and places of religious importance. These are, to the right of the lama: Khan sar gon (name of a place), Skyor mo lun Monastery, Drepung Monastery, a place of getting the ordination, Rinchen Hillock, Potala, Ramoche Cathedral (where the image from China came), Godang Khangsar (monastery) and right below the main lama is Jokhang. To his left are: Sera Monastery, White Rock Hermitage and Bde chen Monastery (This identification of places was done by Dr. Lokesh Chandra who read each inscription).\nA very early style of depicting stories in mini composition is adopted here. Each episode is depicted in a small composition without any formal division, with the help of natural surroundings like clouds, open space, figural, natural and architectural forms and are rendered with minute details in subdued colours, giving it a rhythmic appearance.\nStrong political and cultural relation of Tibet with China seems to have influenced the art of Tibet in many aspects, two of which are concerned with cloth painting. One is the tradition of representations of Arhat in the cloth painting introduced by a Chinese monk Lume and an Indian monk Atisa around 10th century CE and secondly, the introduction of landscape in the art of cloth painting which was basically figure-oriented. This tradition developed in Eastern Tibet perhaps in Karmapa monastery but by the end of the 16th century, the innovative Tibetan artists have developed a very distinct and interesting style of narration which owes very little to Chinese paintings.

The first Baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, sent three weavers from the Joshi family of Surat to the master weaver Chhoi in Shanghai, to learn the art of Chinese silk weaving of a particular kind, around 1856 CE. When they returned after acquiring a considerable command over this art, they bore the name of their master \u2018Chhoi\u2019. The material woven by them was called \u2018Tanchoi\u2019, meaning the material made by the three (tan) chhois. Tanchoi sari was so popular with the Parsis that practically every home possessed at least one. It also occupied its place in the marriage trousseau of the Parsi bride. The basic technique of Tanchoi is the \u2018twill\u2019 weave, and \u2018sateen\u2019 weave which can produce an unbroken surface of colour while retaining sufficient strength in the structure. Coloured warps and wefts produce elaborate designs in polychrome. Instead of alternate threads of warp and weft weaving in the plain cloth, in \u2018twill\u2019 and \u2018sateen\u2019 the interval is increased. The \u2018twill\u2019 weaving which produces a much closer fabric than the plain satin weave, was employed specially for the pallus. The rest of the sari was woven by \u2018sateen\u2019 weaves. The patterns, particularly of the ground of the sari, or of the plain material, are arranged in diagonal formations such as the lozenges, and most complex designs are formed by variations of the same. Proper balance between the thickness of the warp and the weft, correct calculation of the number of picks required for the design and accurate blow of the comb to compact the weft while weaving and the quality of the raw material determine the perfection of the final product. The most important test of the Tanchoi is the complete absence of loose long floats on the other side of the fabric, even if they are required at long intervals in the pattern.Even in the most intricate designs, such floats are not permissible in Tanchoi weaving.

Well-to-do women from Iran to Egypt wore it folded diagonally round the waist or shoulders, or draped over the head as a veil. Rumals were also popular on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the fashion being to wrap one around the shoulders and across the front of a woman\u2019s low-cut dress.\nRumals were primarily kani shawls skillfully put together from many pieces by the rafugar (needle worker) whose expertise was such that their seams were all but invisible. These assembled patchwork shawls were generally defined by large butas that often occupied most of the space. Towards the latter half of the 19th century, the motifs became so large as to cover the entire expanse, as seen in the shawl shown here. The white octagonal centre is surrounded by elongated butas stretching the length from the ends towards the centre, in deep reds, purples, and greens. The butas are filled with small flowers; larger ones appear in the border.

The borders, woven in a figurative design, have been recycled from a Kashmir kani pashmina shawl. A shawl-maker has taken the border, split it lengthwise, and stitched it on to the yellow fabric, making the upper part the end borders and the lower part the side borders. The figurative design includes women wearing what could be a short sari; some women have a basket attached around their waist. The male figures are dressed in fitted pants and a short top; some also appear to be holding an elongated container. Birds, elephants, tigers, and cheetahs can also be seen.\nThe first known figurative shawls date from the late 18th century and after. But it is hard to imagine what the actual piece must have looked like with so little surviving. Were there figures all over the shawl or only on the borders? Figurative shawls were not usually intended as garments to be worn, but were used as floor-spreads, hangings, or coverings of various sorts. They were usually embroidered, as this allowed a more minute delineation of features, but a few made (like the one shown here) using the twill-tapestry method are known. Figurative designs usually included shikargah (hunting) scenes or other figurative elements, often incorporated into the usual buta repeat format, of which the shawl here is an example.

After leaving an outline of the base fabric, the space between is filled with small flowers meandering off a vine. A narrow border, with blooming flowers and curving leaves, runs all the way around the shawl and separates the pallav from the field. The field is covered with smaller butas facing alternate directions, and changing orientation at mid-point so that the shawl hangs correctly at both ends. These smaller butas are also worked from a multi-floral pattern; around them scrolls the same floral pattern as in the pallav.

Here, fine embroidery is known by the Farsi word suzani, which is a generic term for embroidery. Suzani which has developed an extensive and diverse design repertoire that utilizes a variety of stitches including darning and double-darning stitches, running, buttonhole, stem, satin, herringbone, knot, and couching. There are two features that set Kashmiri embroidery apart from other embroidery traditions \u2013 one is the imitation kani stitch, a stem stitch reinforced by a very fine couching stitch; this is known as the suzani stitch. The other is the use of scissors to cut the loose threads from the back of the fabric so that there are no floats visible on the reverse.\nFor most embroidered shawls the designs are block-printed onto the fabric using intricately carved walnut-wood blocks. The embroidery on this shawl is worked on a cream background in deep shades of red, pink, blue, yellow, green, and brown. The pallav is very narrow and the entire body of the shawl is worked with scrolling vines that meander diagonally across the surface from which emerge small butas, flowering plants, and leaves.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nTextiles and Costumes of India\nOBJECT TYPE\nTextile\nMATERIAL\nPashmina embroidered with silk thread\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nLate 19th Century CE\nLOCATION\nKashmir\nDIMENSION\n217.5 x 127.5 cm","524":"Patka \u2013 Sash\n22.3137\nDESCRIPTION\nThe patka or waist-sash was widely worn by men of the Indian nobility from the 16th to the 19th century. These sashes were made of fine muslin or silk brocade, but some exquisite pieces were also made of kani pashmina. Visual records from this period give ample evidence of men wearing patkas in the courts of Mughal, Rajput, and Sikh rulers, amongst others. Most patkas dated to before the middle of the 18th century have the classic format of a plain field surrounded by decorated borders and pallavs. The first modifications in patkas seem to have been introduced in the second half of the 18th century and consisted of stripes (khat-rast). This vertical patterning was most appropriate to their use as a waist-sash.The stripes could be either of equal width in alternating colours, or else a more complex sequence of broad and narrow stripes in several colours.\nThis patka has alternating wide and narrow stripes in repeat colours \u2013 the broad stripes are yellow and white, the narrow ones red and black. The stripes are filled with scrolling floral vines. Both ends of the pallav are made up of three large butas, each densely packed with patterned bouquets.

The trend was largely set by Josephine, Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s wife, who it is claimed owned anything from 60 to 400 shawls.\nThe shawls were valued both for their beauty and the innumerable ways in which they could be draped. But because of their high cost the French and English began to look for alternative ways to produce the Kashmir shawl \u2013 at the beginning of the 19th century the Jacquard was invented, a semi-automated loom which had the means to weave complex patterned designs using several different colours.\nThis is a European shawl made on a Jacquard loom, its design derived from Kashmir prototypes. As weavers in Europe grew more proficient on the Jacquard loom and designers more flamboyant, the inherent design of the Kashmir shawl changed. Pallavs grew bigger and bigger and were accompanied by broad side borders, till finally the centre field all but disappeared and the pattern swept over the entire surface of the shawl.This is exemplified in the shawl here, with its long sweeping butas that extend till the centre leaving only a partial black space marking the middle of the shawl.\nSir D.J.Tata Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nTextiles and Costumes of India\nOBJECT TYPE\nTextile\nMATERIAL\nWool\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nMid 19th Century CE\nLOCATION\nEurope\nDIMENSION\n320 x 160 cm","527":"Abochhini \u2013 Woman\u2019s Wedding Shawl\n22.3205\nDESCRIPTION\nIn many parts of the Indian subcontinent distinctively embroidered textiles are even today part of the trousseau of the groom as well as the bride and play an important role in their married life.

Chillies and other smaller floral discs are interspersed in the overall pattern. The border has floral and solar discs enclosed within a trellis pattern, indicative of Islamic influence. This suzani was probably made to adorn the home of a rich merchant or aristocrat. Such pieces were usually commissioned from women embroiderers of the surrounding villages, such as Chafrikan and Gizhduban. The design would be drawn out on four to six narrow woven strips of hand-woven cotton (karbos) by the local designer (kalamkash), who was also a woman. Each strip was given to a different embroiderer in the family, and then the finished strips were stitched together. This accounts for the slight misalignment of design often seen in these large embroideries.\nA distinctive feature of Bukharan suzanis is the masterful use of chain stitch (yurma) worked on the cotton with either a needle or a tambour hook. Basma, often referred to as Bukhara couching, was also widely used. Large surfaces of the cloth were typically covered, leaving only small areas of background free. The brilliant colours of the silk and the use of natural motifs created a field of magnificent, almost iridescent, flowering forms enhanced by the contrasting texture of the different types of stitch.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nTextiles and Costumes of India\nOBJECT TYPE\nTextile\nMATERIAL\nCotton embroidered with silk thread\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n19th Century CE\nLOCATION\nUzbekistan, probably Bukhara\nDIMENSION\n227 x 169 cm","529":"Suzani\n22.3165\nDESCRIPTION\nThis suzani was probably used as a covering for a small bed or a canopy.

The original design was created for a pair of carpets that were probably made in Ardebil, Iran, in the mid- 16th century and placed in the mosque of Ardebil. Over time and through constant use the carpets were badly damaged and in 1890 were sold to a British carpet dealer. He restored one of them, using parts ofthe other, and sold it to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He also managed to salvage a part of the second carpet, which passed through the hands of several wealthy buyers, eventually reaching J. Paul Getty who donated it to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\nThe Ardebil carpet is significant for its use of the medallion pattern. In the centre is a circular polylobate medallion set off by 16 radiating ogival medallions prolonged at each end by a mosque lamp and by quarter medallions placed in the spandrels, on a field of finely traced spiral arabesque tendrils surrounded by a cartouche border. At one end of the carpet is an inscription, which the copy in the Tata Collection also bears.

They traded silk, textiles, precious stones, and manifold other goods and received payment in the form of niska \u2014 gold and silver coins. As currencies changed across the trade route, they converted their earnings to jewellery and carried their wealth in the form of coins strung into necklaces and securely worn on their bodies \u2014 a tradition still followed by many tribes in India.\nThe term niska is mentioned in the Rig Veda as a currency and also with reference to gold necklaces with coins \u2014 niskakantha and niska-griva.

The island of Elephanta is located on the Bombay Harbour.

James Burgess described the statue in 1871 as follows:\n\u201cThis Elephant was 13 feet 2 inches in length and about 7 feet 4 inches high, but its head and neck dropped in September 1814, and subsequently the body sunk down into a shapeless mass of stones, which in 1864 were removed to the Victoria Gardens in Bombay.\u201d\nIts removal was at the suggestion of W.E.

A Portuguese manor house situated on Bombay Island provided a suitable site for a fort and a customs house; a warehouse and quay were also constructed. Seaborne traffic entering Bombay harbour increased considerably during the last few decades of the 17th century CE but as the Company initially depended heavily on the docks at Surat for repairing and graving their vessels, the directors took some time to permit the construction of a dockyard at Bombay, which was eventually constructed in 1694.\nAfter that, all English ships were directed to \u201cEnter at the Bombay Harbour for refitting and graving\u201d. As a result, the revenue for the Company grew. However, as all work at the new dockyard had to be carried out in the open, there were many hazards due to the lack of security and the constant threat of fire. As the workload increased, so did the problems. Consequently, a proper dry dock for refitting and graving was constructed and completed in 1734. Outer fortifications were built around the town of Bombay along with several public buildings, including the Church of St. Thomas. In this view, Bombay Castle (on the right) is seen from across the harbour, with the custom house and its pier, the church and the flagstaff.\nGift of Pauline and Roy Rohatgi\nCOLLECTION\nPrints, Drawings and Photographs\nARTIST\nJan van Ryne (1712\u20131760)\nOBJECT TYPE\nPrint\nMATERIAL\nColoured line engraving\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nModern\nTECHNIQUE\nEngraving\nDATE\n1754\nLOCATION\nLondon\nDIMENSION\n26.5 x 40.5 cms","559":"Cawnpore\n2015.63\nDESCRIPTION\nDrawn by S.

Ivory objects were found at several of the Indus Valley sites, (3300 B.C. - 1800 B.C.). Since then, ivory as a medium was used for carving all kinds of objects. They include images, utilitarian objects like jewellery boxes, combs, paper cutters, frames as well as jewellery pieces. Very interestingly ivory was used for making furniture, like the backs of thrones, cots, chairs, doors, palanquins etc. It was even used for carving hilts of swords, daggers and gunpowder flasks.\nDelhi, Agra, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Murshidabad, Mysore and Vishakhapattanam were some of the centres of ivory craft. The craft is now almost at a standstill due to the ban on the trade of ivory to protect elephants.

Sidi Sayyid was a slave of Ahmad Shah (r. 1422\u201336 ce), who rose to wealth and power.\nThe sanctuary of the mosque has walls composed largely of perforated stone screens for light and ventilation. Such screens were common in Gujarat architecture. However, in the Sidi Sayyid Mosque, the artist showed exceptional vision and treated these jalis as a canvas creating beautiful ornamental forms. One of the subjects thus presented is the \u201cPalm and Parasite\u201d motif, a common and natural phenomenon in Indian plant life. The present tray depicts the same motif.

It is not exactly known whether the huqqa was introduced in the Mughal court through Persia or elsewhere; it is supposed to have been introduced from the Deccan during Akbar\u2019s reign. Mughal and Deccani paintings show huqqas being smoked by both male and female nobility.

It was very likely made in Bombay in the workshop of a Mr Gill in the early 20th century. Neither its function nor the exact techniques of its manufacture are known. The metalwork seems cast rather than beaten. Mr Gill\u2019s workshop was known to produce objects that closely copied ancient architectural designs and mythological scenes. The Museum\u2019s Tata Collection has several silver objects from Mr Gill\u2019s workshop.\nThe inspiration for this mandapa comes from the famous Jain temples at Mount Abu in Rajasthan which is a major place of pilgrimage for Jains. The upper and lower trays are marvellous adaptations of the dome and ceiling panels respectively,of the rangamandapa (assembly hall) of the Lunavasahi Temple. This temple was constructed in 1230 ce by Tejahpala, minister of the Solanki king, Bhima.\nThe lower tray is supported on the curled trunks of eight elephant heads. Above these are hexagonal stambha (columns), each tapering upward. At the top of each column is the miniature figure of a seated Jina. Between every two pillars is the stambhatorana, a multicusped arch stamped with the valika (ear ornament) design.\nThe most striking elements of this object are the two trays. In the lower tray is a large sunken square with its corners touching four sides of the outer octagon. A smaller sunken square within this has an exact replica of one of the ceiling panels of the Lunavasahi Temple, showing the birth of Krishna. The entire lower tray is an imitation of a samatalavitana, a ceiling with a geometrically uniform pattern.\nThe design of the upper tray is an adaptation of the inside of the dome of the same temple. The central projecting element is the padmashila (pendant lotus medallion). Sixteen figures depicting celestial nymphs are borne on projecting shelves by flying support figures (vidyadhara, or \u201cwisdom bearers\u201d).

The dragon depicted on the handle has a small ball in its mouth, and perhaps represents the Buddhist symbol \u2013 the dragon who won the Pearl of Wisdom.

The tray rests on five balls fabricated as legs.\nFatehpur Sikri \u2013 \u201cCity of Victory\u201d \u2013 was the new capital city set up by Emperor Akbar. He constructed this capital to celebrate and commemorate the fulfilment of his long-standing wish of having a son. It was in the year 1569 that Prince Muhammad Salim was born at the residence of a Sufi mystic Shaykh Salim-ad-Din Chishti at Sikri. To give outward splendour to this spot Akbar commissioned the construction of Fatehpur Sikri.\nFatehpur Sikri became a centre of art and learning during Akbar\u2019s reign. The city complex had karkhanas (imperial workshops), a kitabkhana (library), an ibadatkhana (place for philosophical discussions), and many other buildings. Mahal-i-Ilahi, popularly known as Raja Birbal\u2019s House, was the largest and finest of the domestic buildings in Fatehpur Sikri \u2013 setting aside the royal residence.

Cuttack in Orissa and Karimnagar in Andhra Pradesh are the two most famous centres of this craft, known for their very delicate workmanship.The technique involves melting 16 parts of silver with one part of lead and casting it into bars or sticks by pouring it into moulds. The next stage involves beating the bars or sticks into plates and wires. Designs or patterns are formed by taking the wires one by one, and carefully arranging them on a mica sheet, bonded by a special cement. The different parts are then joined by soldering. The ready article is cleaned and given the finishing touches.\nThis pandan consists of five rectangular boxes with lids, placed on a tray. The large box in the centre is for betel-leaves and the four small boxes around it are to hold the spices \u2013 betel-nuts, cardamoms, cloves, etc. \u2013 used for the preparation of the paan.

In some cases a glass surface was engraved and then gold foil rubbed into the pattern and fixed by fire. This is a rough account of the thewa process given by researchers, but the thewa craftsmen never revealed all the details of their skill to anyone. The art was confined to a few families, a son learning it from his father. Daughters were never allowed to enter the workshops; the technique was never revealed to them so that it would remain a family secret.\nThewa objects include pieces of jewellery like pendants, earrings, belts, etc. and also trays, rosewater sprinklers, card boxes, cigarette boxes, and vases which were specially made for the European market.\nThis card table is a unique piece. It is made of moulded silver and set with pieces of thewa work. The top of the table has six square thewa pieces while the sides have rectangular pieces. They have intricate designs in gold foil on green glass depicting royal hunting scenes in typical Rajasthani style. It is interesting to note the machans (structures for hunting) and the matchlock guns in the hands of hunters which were very popular in the early 18th\u201319th century.

There are two other manuscripts\u2013 one in the Raza Library at Rampur and the other, belonging to the mid 19th century, in the British Library, London.\nAnis-al-Haj or Anis-ul-Hajjaj is a travelogue by Safi bin Vali Qazvin who was patronized by Zeb-un-Nisa, the daughter of Aurangzeb who sent him to perform the Haj. The author embarked on his journey in 1676 A.D. and on his return he meticulously recorded the details of the preparations and the journey in this travelogue.\nThe manuscript has twenty eight paintings, illustrating various episodes of the journey. It starts with the map of the Port of Surat from where he boarded the ship to Jeddah.\nThe paintings depict topographic details in illustrations of important locations, and interesting details in the depiction of gatherings, processions, and other scenes. This may lead us to surmise that the artist may have some reference by way of drawings for him to be able to paint these so vividly.\nThis illustration depicts the port of Surat in a conventional style. The fort on the bank of the river Tapti was repaired over and over again by the Mughal kings including Emperor Akbar. The inner fortification, with four bastions, was the central area of activity during the 16th to the 18th century, till the Bombay harbour was developed. Three masted ships are anchored on the bank with life boats. The highly stylized sails appear almost like balloons. The Hajis or the Haj pilgrims are lined up on the upper deck. The ships seem to have special cabins at the stern. The fort wall around the city, may not have been a perfect rectangle as is shown here, though the six gates are authentic. The city had a special jetty for the ships travelling to the Haj known as the Makka Ovaro, a place which is still in existence. The artist seems quite familiar with the harbour and the surrounding areas. The six gates starting from the left are named Majura, Navsari, Sara, Variavi, Burhanpur and Bharuch.\nThe composition of the paintings, their draughtsmanship, the use of colours and the costumes\u2013 all these reveal affinity with the Deccani style of painting.\nThe colophon gives some information about the book.

A famous classic of Persian literature, it consists of five poems: Makhnul Asarar (not dated), Khusru-wa Shirin (1584 ce), Haft Paikar (1584 ce), Laila Majnu (1583 ce), and Sikandar Nama (not dated). Among these, only Haft Paikar is illustrated.\nHaft Paikar is the story of Prince Behram, the son of Yazdegar, King of Persia. He was an expert in the game of hunting and achieved the title Gur \u2013 wild ass \u2013 after killing a fighting lion and wild ass with one arrow. Later he married seven beautiful princesses from different countries. He then ordered his most talented architect Shideh to build a palace for each of the seven princesses. Shideh, true to his abilities, built seven palaces with different coloured domes constructed according to the positions of the planets and their respective colours. Behram decided to visit the princesses one by one according to the day of the week, and requested each of them to tell him a story.\nThe seven stories told by seven princesses reflect seven different stages in the philosophical journey of human life. Behram first visits the princess in the black pavilion, which symbolizes the mystery of god hidden by the veil of ignorance. His journey ends at the palace of Princess Diroste, which is white, a symbol of divine purity and unity.\nThe colophon pages of the manuscript do not mention the name of the scribe. However, the notes in Persian before the beginning of the second and third masnavi give information about the owner of the book in a later period. It seems that in the mid-17th century this book was in the possession of a Mughal noble who took it with him on the expedition to Kandahar led by Prince Muhammad Aurangzeb. The study of these notes yields very interesting information about the movements of the royal army and the distances covered. After this, the manuscript seems to have gone into the possession of one Karam Ahmed Saheb. The text on the last page of the manuscript says: \u201cKaram Ahmed Saheb purchased this manuscript and now it is his property whoever claims it will not have any good\u201d.The seal on this page is illegible.\nThe painting illustrates the visit of Behram Gur to the red Pavilion of Princess Nasrin, the daughter of the ruler of the slaves. The day is Tuesday which is ruled by the planet Mars. A haloed Behram Gur is shown seated inside the pavilion with the princess. Both wear Persian-style robe and headgear. The feast time is over and now Princess Nasrin is telling Prince Behram a story in the company of her five maids.\nIntricate jali windows add to the grandeur of the palace and provide a suitable backdrop for the couple. The rendering of the human figures and decorative elements are inspired by Safavid paintings, but the heavy shading on the chin and the general posture are Indian influences.\nThe headgear worn by Princess Nasrin is worth discussing here. The cloth cap with a golden diadem, an elongated and curved tailpiece, and a scarf hanging behind the head can be compared very well with the painting of a princess in a Tabriz album in the collection of Harvard University Art Museum.\nThe princess here is wearing a similar but more refined version of the headgear with the addition of a golden finial and a pearl strap. This type of headgear appears in early Safavid court paintings and is later copied in a simpler form in late-16th-century paintings. The headgear of Behram is also inspired by Safavid-style paintings.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nInk and opaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nDated ah 992 = 1584 ce\nLOCATION\nDeccan\nDIMENSION\nFolio 21.7 x 16.3 cm, painting 6.1 x 12.5 cm","596":"Prince Dara Shikoh with His Mentor\n22.3432\nDESCRIPTION\nPrince Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan was deeply interested in Sufi philosophy.

His dark complexion, small straight nose, thin raised eyebrows, well-trimmed beard, and more particularly the patterned jama (tunic) confirm his identity.The Museum records earlier identified this figure as Muhammad Adil Shah, which needs to be revised, as it differs from well-established portraits of the sultan.\nHere, Ikhlas Khan is listening attentively to the yogi sitting in front of him. The yogi wears a loincloth tied with a rope made of munj (a grass). He has Shaivite tilaka marks on his forehead and upper arms, and spiky matted locks.

Masulipatnam in Golconda was a famous centre of textile-printing from the 17th\u201319th centuries, supplying to the Western market with huge curtain backdrops and other materials created by a combination of wood block printing and hand painting. The present piece is an excellent example of Masulipatnam work in textile printing. Tinsel work comprises the use of an adhesive substance which is printed over the texture and subsequently dusted with colouring matter. Here in this piece, it appears that yellow coloured adhesive is first printed over the required designs and pure gold leaf is then laid on them indiscriminately. It is then dried in the shade, rolled up and unrolled bit by bit after being moistened with a wet cloth. When it is adequately damp, gold is daubed over the surface.\nThe painting illustrates the theme of the Tree worship, an old Indian tradition surviving till today. Highly stylised flowering tree in the center is difficult to identify. A group of four ladies is standing on either side of the tree, one behind the other, offering their obeisance to it. The first one waves an arati with several wicks while the remaining three hold a fan, a chauri and a morchal. Clad in bright coloured Rajasthani costume of brocaded ghagra (skirt), choli (blouse) and odhni, and decorated with profuse ornaments, these women possess large eyes and strong features.\nThe top panel represents a forest which includes a large variety of birds and animals. The central tree is laden with flowers with parrots perched on its branches. The tree has a peculiar balloon-shaped canopy which is enclosed in a running border of black chain, used almost as an outline of the painting. This singular tree on top of the hill is flanked by a peacock on either side. The hill is represented by a series of serrated rocks with a variety of birds, animals and trees. An amazing variety of birds and animals, both tame and wild, seem to be consciously included by the designer, to create an environment of a bountiful forest. The broad border running along on all the four sides have bold floral creeper designs.\nThis may be a stylised representation of the worship of Kalpavriksha\u2013 the wish fulfilling tree.

Far behind are the domes and balconies of the palace.

His beloved Bani-Thani is immortalized in many portraits in the form of Radha. In fact Radha and Krishna in Kishangarh paintings from the period of Savant Singh onwards, are stylized translations of the features of Bani-Thani and her lover prince Savant Singh. The present painting is one such example. Krishna wears a typical kind of pagdi known as albeliye pechon ka lapeta, an invention of Nagari Das.\nThe sensitive features of the lovers are a landmark of this school, particularly during the time of artist Nihal Chand.

The Museum has a wide range of such paintings. Though the landscape and actions are repetitive, the ladies represent a lyrical charm, as is attested by this portrait of an elegant princess.\nThe profile of the princess is drawn against a copper-green background, typical of the Deccan. Seated at a jharoka window the princess wears a muslin jama (tunic), a dupatta (veil), a Jahangiri turban, and pearl jewellery. She leans against a bolster, and holds a flower in her hand.\nEmperor Akbar (1556-1605) started the tradition of jharoka darshan whereby the emperor would sit in a jharoka or a balcony window and give his subjects a chance to see him. The jharoka darshan portrait showing only a bust in profile became increasingly popular during Shahjahan\u2019s reign (1627-58). Artists who came to the Deccan from the Mughal courts may have introduced this style of portraiture here. The princess with arched eyebrows, lotusshaped eyes, high forehead, and small tight lips represents a picture of typical Deccani beauty.\nA beautiful qitta (calligraphic note) on the reverse says:\nHe is the source of honour\nMay the sun of your good fortune shine\nforever\nMay the lightning of your sword\nilluminate the world forever\nMay your pleasant heart fulfil the desire\nof your friends\nMay your fine existence last till\neternity.\nThe borders of the portrait and the calligraphic panel are decorated with bold flower patterns.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour and gold on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n18th Century CE\nLOCATION\nHydrabad\nDIMENSION\n44 x 27.8 cm (with border), 22.5 x 14.1 cm (without border)","605":"Portrait of Shah Jahan\n15.278\nDESCRIPTION\nA green background, often seen in the portraits of this period, this is a formal portrait of the king during the period of his waning glory.

This practice led to the creation of many illustrated copies of the text. The pothi format of the manuscripts shows a continuation of the palm-leaf tradition. The oldest known manuscript on paper belongs to 1307 CE and is in the collection of Muni Shri Jina Vijayaji at Ahmedabad. The Kalpasutra is a canonical text of the Shvetambara (white-clad) Jains written by Acharya Bhadrabahu in the 4th century BCE. It is the biographical account of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers of the Jains), generally read and recited by devotees during their ten days of fasting known as Parushan in the month of Bhadrapada, August \u2013 September. The text of the Kalpasutra deals with panchakalyanakas, the five most auspicious events in the life of a Tirthankara \u2013 birth, lustration, renunciation, enlightenment, and nirvana (salvation).\nThe Kalakacharyakatha is often appended to the Kalpasutra. The style of illustration in both manuscripts is characterized by rigid and exaggerated sharpness, and the use of monochromatic colours particularly red, lapis-lazuli blue, gold, black, and white. Jain patrons of the 15th century CE preferred very opulent illustrations richly painted in gold.\nA particular stylistic feature is an eye that protrudes from the face in the three-quarter profile.

Hence, the creations of this period possess that fresh vigour and vitality in every glance and gesture, pulsating colour, and high-strung rhythm which so often characterize the beginning of a truly significant movement in art.\nThis work has been regarded by all critics who have seen it as one of the most beautiful Basohli miniatures which has hitherto come to light. Its fascination is largely due to its brilliant colour orchestration and the naive handling of the theme At the foot of a little knoll in the forest, depicted by a circle of trees, sit the two lovers amorously gazing at each other. There is a suggestion of demureness in Radha's attitude as she draws her odhani closer round her body, but the bold-eyed Krishna has no inhibitions. His ardour is candid, his approach passionate and direct. He is little disposed to indulge in the art of subtle wooing. In the quiet of the forest where only gaily plumed birds flit from one colourful mass of foliage to another, Radha surrenders to the Blue God.\nBeyond the forest, on the bank of the Yamuna, a cowherd has spread his wrap and fallen asleep, fanned by the cool breeze which gently ruffles the lazy river. A white cow, whose colour balances the white frill of Radha's skirt, sleeps near the cowherd, while another with upraised head scents the air as though it has intimation of Krishna's presence in the forest.\nTwo main forms of male attire are to be found in Pahari paintings. The first is the dhoti, with the upper part of the body remaining bare though a dupatta is usually thrown over the shoulders and across the chest. This is the standard costume for Krishna. He wears a girdle of bells and a patka is attached to the front of the dhoti Shiny green particles of beetlewing are frequently employed to depict emeralds.\nThe painting is not likely to post-date the last decade of the 17th century and its colour organization and colour rhythm are unequalled in the whole range of Basohli miniature paintings.\nIt should be noted that in keeping with the intense, passionate, wide-eyed faces of men and women in Basohli art, even the cattle here are not the gentle, well-rounded kine, so characteristic of the Indian scene and depicted in Kangra miniatures. These have lean, narrow bodies, set on rather high legs, and their small narrow heads with somewhat wild eyes, are usually turned upwards as though in search of their beloved friend Krishna.\nThe formula for delineating a forest by means of a circle of trees occupying the main picture space is peculiar to and frequently employed in Basohli art.

In Persian, the term todi means to separate. Ragini Todi is also considered a raga of profound sorrow as is explained by the musicians. The deepest experience of separation in every Indian household, is the occasion of sending the daughter to the in-laws, after marriage. A vivid description of the moment is given by the poet Kalidasa in his famous drama, Abhijnana Shakuntalam. The imagery used in the iconography of this ragini is probably derived from the description of Shakuntala and her little deer, at the time of her departure from Kanva\u2019s hermitage. She is offering some fresh grass and coaxing the little deer to return to the hermitage. It may be interesting to note that some folk songs of western India, sung at this particular time of bidding farewell to the daughter after marriage, are known as tada. It is possible that the ragini is based on the songs sung at this time of the wedding.\nThe heroine, dressed in a deep green choli and red skirt, appears to be talking to the deer following her, affectionately persuading it to return. Her very thin waist, highly curved hips, her features, the pompom decorations, a long plaited braid of hair and a flat red background conform to the Popular Mughal style of painting.\nIn the Sangitadamodara, a 15th\u201316th century text on music, the dhyana of the musical mode Todi reads: \u201cTodi is (lady) whose eyes are as charming as the full-blown lotus, who is beautiful like a garland of blue lotus blossoms, who approaches (presents) a young antelope with a shoot of rice.\u201d\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMughal\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nDated 1605 CE\nLOCATION\n--\nDIMENSION\nFull page: 15.6 x 21.6 cms.

The orange sky of the evening is empty of the flutter of chirping birds. Vali, huge even as he lies on the ground, is wounded by an arrow aimed at him by Rama, an ally of his younger brother Sugriva. The episode where Rama hid behind a tree and shot Vali while he was engaged in combat with Sugriva is narrated in the 23rd Sarga of the Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana.\nRama, Lakshmana, and Sugriva stand close to Vali. Vali's face is distraught with the agony of death as he asks, \"Rama, I was engaged in a fight with another man (Sugriva), for what did you then strike me down?\" Rama, painted blue, is trying to pacify Vali by explaining the reasons for his unforgivable act, as suggested by the gesture of his hands. Sugriva, though victorious, seems sad at the death of his brother. The vast undulating green ground of the forest has a few trees - one of them with branches but without a canopy, and one with a crooked trunk. The limited use of colours and the bare foreground reflect the mood of the occasion. The fair complexioned Vali, Sugriva, and Lakshmana and the white stone cover of the cave suitably contrast with the green ground, while the bluish hollow of the cave balances with the blue Rama.\nThe scene, very sensitively handled here by a Guler artist, is rarely depicted in other Ramayana series.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\nIndian Miniature painting\nDATE\n1750 CE\nLOCATION\nGuler, Himachal Pradesh\nDIMENSION\n20.8 x 32 cms.","610":"Court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh\n33.100\nDESCRIPTION\nThe hill states of Guler, Nurpur, and Kangra came under Sikh rule in the early 19th century.

This imperial copy of the Razm Nama is preserved in the Maharaja Sawai Madav Mansingh II Museum in Jaipur. As mentioned by Badauni in his Muntakhab-ut-tawarihk, once the royal copy was made, the nobles of the court of Akbar also acquired copies of the illustrated imperial Razm Nama for themselves. Three such illustrated copies have come to light, the folios of which are dispersed in various museums. This museum has ten folios of the Razm Nama belonging to the dated set of 1598 A.D. which was illustrated for Abdul Rahim Khan Khanan, who is mentioned in the colophon as the patron of the manuscript.\nThe text is written on the reverse and sometimes, as in the Akbari paintings, it is written in a box inserted into the painting itself. Obviously, the style is not very homogenous but the format remains the same. The inferior workmanship and at times, slightly haphazard composition reveals its experimental character as illustrations are not a product of the imperial atelier.\nThis is an incident from the Anushasanaparvan of the Mahabharata. Yudhisthira asked Bhishma, lying on the bed of arrows after the Mahabharata was over,about the virtues of giving food to others in this world. Bhishma related to Yudhisthira his conversation with Narada to whom he had asked the same question.\nThe painting depicts Narada talking to Bhishma on the subject with the help of the ancient text.

Azam Shah, the son of Aurangzeb, is enjoying some light moments, as earlier in the day he had gone for bird shooting with an entourage of women. On his way back he is proceeding with them to a pleasure garden where his beloved Chandap is awaiting him.\nThe foreground of the painting is a pleasure grove, where Chandap, identified by an inscription, is reclining on a couch, entertained by her companions and maids. She is listening to the Veena, while her companions offer her drink and pan. Another inscription identifies Chand Bano \u2018Mushtaq\u2019 who is comfortably leaning against a tree, eagerly waiting for somebody. A group of ladies is sitting behind the Veena player while two ladies are enjoying their swim in the lake which is connected with a small canal. The sound created by Azam Shah\u2019s jubilant party arriving there, has probably drawn the attention of one woman who looks behind in that direction. The female figures are drawn with easy flow of line of the Golconda artist. Instead of highly contrasting colours of the costumes, these women are distinguished by their big bright eyes and beautiful well-proportioned figures.\nSir Akbar Haydari Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nCloth Painting\nMATERIAL\nPainting on cloth\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nMid 17th century CE\nLOCATION\nDeccan\nDIMENSION\n121 x 83 cms.","614":"An Assembly of Dervishes\n15.301\nDESCRIPTION\nJahangir inherited Akbar\u2019s interest in sadhus and saints, sufis and dervishes. He is recorded to have visited sufis and dervishes, presented books to the sheikhs in Gujarat and got his artists to document his meetings with them in their paintings. He also had them portrayed on different occasions. Practice of depicting holy men in paintings continued even after Jahangir, probably due to Dara Shiko\u2019s interest in philosophy.\nThe painting seems to be the left side page of a double spread illustration in an album. The right side or the facing page would probably be a depiction of a holy place in front of which the dervishes are praying. There are two principle figures\u2013 a bearded sheikh dressed in a white cassock and a striped garment over it, whereas a shaven-headed dervish in full green gown is seated with a yoga patta. Both of them are engrossed in deep prayer for the mercy of God. The other figures are looking on attentively probably at a scene which must have been illustrated on the opposite page. These five seated figures, three of whom have a book with them, are dressed in different coloured garments breaking the monotony of the bare background. A young lad, standing behind, curiously looking at the scene in front, must be an attendant or a follower of one of the dervishes. A man seated right near the red railing has a fruit basket in his hand probably brought as an offering. There is an atmosphere of gloom, may be an hour of trial, for which God\u2019s intervention is sought. Plain vast spaces covering almost half the painting on top expresses humbleness of man before the immensity of the Infinite whose mercy is prayed for.\nThe name of the artist Hunhar is inscribed at the bottom left corner of the painting. The Qita in Nastaliq on the reverse is written in Persian. It is designed by the famous calligrapher of Akbar\u2019s court, Muhammad Hussain Ali Kashmiri. Praising his calligraphy, Abul Fazl writes, \u201c The artist who in the shadow of the throne of his Majesty, has become been honoured with a title of Zarin Qalam, a gold pen.

Despite this, Parvati decided to attend and on reaching there, found to her dismay that no seat was reserved for Shiva in the celebration. Deeply hurt at this insult, she immolated herself in the fire altar. Her attendants, the Pramathas and the Guhyakas, enraged by Daksha\u2019s behaviour attacked him with the intention of killing him. Sage Bhrigu immediately performed a sacrifice to save Daksha. From the altar arose the Ribhus, armed with firebrands, and drove away the Pramathas.\nIn the upper panel is a group of rishis helplessly watching the advancing Pramathas aiming their weapons at Daksha, who is seated with his wife in the centre, facing the altar, from which the Ribhus are emerging. In the lower panel are seen the aggressive Ribhus and the retreating Pramathas, while a group of women are watching the scene.\nA cluster of trees placed vertically demarcates the two locations. On Mount Kailasa Narada is breaking the news to Shiva and then as the Purana mentions, \u201cShiva got enraged and bit his lips. He pulled out a matted lock of hair, sprang to his feet and dashed it on the ground\u201d. The second locale faithfully depicts this scene.\nSahebdin, to whom this painting can be easily attributed, is the first known artist of Mewar who has produced several illustrated sets of epics and the Bhagavata Purana. Sahebdin\u2019s palette is of bright enamel colours, red, grey, blue and purple. His style is a continuation of the earlier style of manuscript illustrations.

The swing festival known as jhulan in the month of Sharavana (July-August) is associated with Krishna.The fact that Krishna was envisaged in the form of the cowherd, and led the life of a rustic youth, afforded the poets of the Krishna Lila endless opportunities to weave commonplace situations into the theme of Krishna's dalliances with Radha and the fair maids of Braj. Swinging was one such sport that provided this opportunity to the painters.Apparently the painting focuses on Radha on a swing tied to the branch of a tree, but the purport of the painting is different. As Krishna swings Radha high in the sky, she loses her hold and is about to fall. Her beloved holds her in his arms and she enjoys this intimacy.\nA large tree with a huge canopy and strong branches, holds the swing. Radha's odhani flies high with the forceful swinging. The ropes of the swing are unevenly bent as it is pushed to a great height, much beyond the normal range, probably intentionally. Next we see Krishna and Radha in a tight embrace. Some of the gopis at the left corner of the painting are looking up and expressing their anxiety, while the others witness the lila of Krishna and Radha.\nThe lotus-filled river Yamuna, witness to all Krishna's pranks and mischief, flows calmly in the foreground. A cluster of plantain trees provides a beautiful background to Krishna highlighted with a white shadow around his face, typical of the Kotah painting of the period. The shading on the chins of the women is heavy.\nKarl and Meherbai Khandalavala Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nKotah\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1760 CE\nLOCATION\nRajasthan\nDIMENSION\n37.3 x 27.5 cms with border, 28.8 x 18.8 cms without border.","617":"Folio from Kalpasutra and Kalakacharyakatha\n22.3260 A (110 Folios)\nDESCRIPTION\nScript \u2013 Devanagari\nLanguage \u2013 Pali\nAmong the earliest surviving illustrated paper manuscripts in India are copies of the Jain manuscripts of the Kalpasutra (Book of Ritual) and Kalakacharyakatha (the story of the renowned monk Kalaka who lived in the 1st century CE). These manuscripts were commissioned by pious laymen to donate to thebhandara (temple library) of their spiritual teacher. This practice led to the creation of many illustrated copies of the text. The pothi format of the manuscripts shows a continuation of the palm-leaf tradition. The oldest known manuscript on paper belongs to 1307 CE and is in the collection of Muni Shri Jina Vijayaji at Ahmedabad. The Kalpasutra is a canonical text of the Shvetambara (white-clad) Jains written by Acharya Bhadrabahu in the 4th century BCE. It is the biographical account of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers of the Jains), generally read and recited by devotees during their ten days of fasting known as Parushan in the month of Bhadrapada, August \u2013 September. The text of the Kalpasutra deals with panchakalyanakas, the five most auspicious events in the life of a Tirthankara \u2013 birth, lustration, renunciation, enlightenment, and nirvana (salvation).\nThe Kalakacharyakatha is often appended to the Kalpasutra. The style of illustration in both manuscripts is characterized by rigid and exaggerated sharpness, and the use of monochromatic colours particularly red, lapis-lazuli blue, gold, black, and white. Jain patrons of the 15th century CE preferred very opulent illustrations richly painted in gold.\nA particular stylistic feature is an eye that protrudes from the face in the three-quarter profile. Attempts to explain this phenomenon include religious and metaphysical significance, but the reason may have been just technical.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nManuscript\nMATERIAL\nInk, opaque watercolour, and gold on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n16th Century CE\nLOCATION\nWestern India\nDIMENSION\n8.6 x 30 cm","618":"Yearning of Damayanti\n22.3229 F 20\nDESCRIPTION\nFolio 20 from the illustrated manuscript of Nala Daman.\nThe story of Nala Daman originally appears in the Mahabharata and is followed by many different versions in various languages.

Damayanti, the heroine of the story, is shown in the company of three attendants. Deeply lost in her own world of love and desire, she is looking at a portrait of her beloved Nala. Poet Suradas describes how Damayanti herself made the portrait, which was surprisingly identical to Nala, and used to gaze at it throughout the night after her maids went to sleep. She says:\nEven if sleep comes to me\nwhere will I allow her to stay?\nas my eyes who are the temple\nof sleep, now filled up with\nmy beloved and no one else.\nAs described in the story, in spite of her companions\u2019 repeated enquiries about the cause of Damayanti\u2019s sadness, she never opened her heart to them.

Soon after his first sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath, the Buddha decided to visit the brahmin ascetics at the Urubilva village. He went to the hermitage of the oldest brahmin of the Kashyapa clan where he had to take recourse to miracles to make him see the light of the Dharma.\nThe artist has vividly captured this moment when the old Brahmin, amazed to see the Buddha at his door, tried to quickly get up from his seat of a rolled mat, with the support of his right hand. His hut made of bamboo and straw and the sacrificial fire in front, create the atmosphere of a hermitage. Typical of the brahmin ascetics, Kashyapa wears a short dhoti, a beard and a heavy jata tied in a knot on his head and he has a long stick in his left hand for support. The haloed Buddha is arriving at the door of the hermitage with a benign gesture of the abhay mudra, followed by Vajrapani, his constant companion in the Gandhara art.

The four figures in the air above also express in diverse manners their amazement at this remarkable act of renunciation.\nSuch architectonically conceived panels are typical of Gandhara narrative art.

It narrates the complete episode of the birth scene in a single panel.\nQueen Mayadevi is standing holding a branch of a tree with her right hand. To her right, Shakra wearing a cap-like head-dress is receiving the newly born babe, the future Buddha, in his hands. In the lower part of the relief between Mayadevi and Shakra, can be seen the haloed baby Buddha taking his first seven steps, unaided by anybody.\nAccording to the Nidanakatha written in the 1st century BCE. while going to her parents place for confinement, Mayadevi happened to pass through Sala grove and was much fascinated by the blooming trees. Standing there, she held a branch of the tree, and at that moment she started getting labour pains and the child Siddhartha was born. Many different interpretations are offered to explain this pose of Mayadevi at the time of the childbirth. It is interesting to note that a similar custom still prevails in a mountain dwelling tribe of Taraomara in Mexico where an expectant woman selects a branch of a tree near the river for the delivery. As the time draws near, she goes down to that tree, holds the branch tight with both her hands for support and delivers the child. The child is put in a cane basket and carried by her to the jubilant relatives*. It is possible that a similar custom must have been prevalent in the north-eastern India in the early periods which has provided the iconography of the scene of the birth of the Buddha.\nA large number of Gandhara sculptures in this Museum, which are a gift of the renowned scholar James Cousens, were excavated from the sites of Sahri Bahlol (in 1912), Takht-i-bahi (in 1910\u201311), and Jamalgarhi (in 1920\u201321). Most of these sculptures must have adorned the walls of the monasteries, inspiring the devout in their religious pursuits. The sculptures range from large Buddhas seated in meditation, or preaching the congregation or summoning the earth to vouch for his penance, to standing Boddhisattvas, scenes from the life of the Buddha and some decorative panels. All these sculptures, several of them mutilated, bear evidence of Graeco-Roman influence on Indian art which is the main distinction of this style. The artists of these areas excel in carving the elegant flow of the draperies, trees with clearly identifiable leaves and in successfully conveying the architectural details including different levels of the house connected with staircases.\nCOLLECTION\nBuddhist Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nArchitectural fragment\nMATERIAL\nGrey Schist\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nGandharan school\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n3rd century CE\nLOCATION\nGandhara, Pakistan\nDIMENSION\n15.5 x 14.6 x 5.6 cms.","674":"GAJALAKSHMI\nS 66.57\nDESCRIPTION\nPITALKHORA, one of the early caves on the Satamala hills in Maharashtra, is situated approximately 37 kilometres north-west of Ellora, on the caravan route from Sopara through Nasik to Paithan, during the Satavahana rule. Originally discovered in 1853 by John Wilson, the images from Pitalkhora were carefully studied by M.N. Deshpande in 1953.\nThis panel of Gajalakshmi once adorned the centre of the lintel of cave no. 4 at Pitalkhora from where it was discovered. Broken into four pieces, it was buried in the debris at the entrance to the cave. The image shows characteristic Satavahana features, ornaments and costume. She is seated on an inverted open lotus with legs folded in front, joining both the soles. She holds in each hand a long stem of the lotus bud, issuing from below her lotus pedestal. Two big elephants stand on either side on lotuses and anoint her with water poured from a pitcher held in their trunks, over her head. Quite unlike the later depictions, where the scene of elephants pouring water over Lakshmi is depicted symbolically, here they occupy a prominent place in the sculpture. This is to emphasise her connection with water as a source of fertility and prosperity. The artist has managed to accommodate the legs of the elephants in the small space of a lotus flower. There are traces of a decorative kutha or a covering on their mutilated backs.\nThis particular form of Gajalakshmi, and especially the style of depicting the lotus, continues till the Gupta period as is evident from the gold coins of Chandragupta II.

Wearing a dhoti and a shawl, a torque around the neck, and part of an armlet still attached to his right arm, the figure genuflects on his right knee. Unfortunately, both his hands are broken but likely they held an offering. The figure must once have formed part of a more elaborate tableau with a central image of Shakyamuni.\nWhat is clear from the face is that he represents a young boy rather than an adult. The smiling countenance has a beatific expression and he may portray an angelic worshipper rather than a human one. The round, cherubic face is framed with curling locks on three sides and crowning the head is a small topknot. The closest stylistic parallel is the detached head of another boy probably from Hadda in a private collection in Japan. There is a likelihood that this charming kneeling angel is also from Afghanistan, if not Hadda. However, one cannot rule out the possibility of Taxila in Pakistan being a possible source.\nWhatever the exact place of origin, the sculpture clearly shows the unknown sculptor\u2019s mastery of modelling in stucco. Like stone, stucco was a popular medium in Gandhara from at least the 1st century though along with clay it became more popular in the 4th\u20135th century when this engaging and angelic devotee was created.

The assault of Mara was a favourite theme of the artists illustrating the life of the Buddha in stone. The Buddhacharita of Ashvaghosha meticulously describes the appearance of these soldiers or the putras of Mara who assaulted the Buddha, some of them having three faces and long ears like those of an elephant.\nThe terracotta depicts one such creature having two faces, expressing two different emotions. The face on the left side with fully stretched lips and cheeks is supposedly jeering at the Buddha, whereas the other one is fierce with a wide open mouth exposing a full row of teeth. Big round eyeballs of both these faces bulge out of their eye sockets. Their ears carved high up on the temple, combine to form a circle between neatly arranged tassels of hair, while their whiskers protrude from the joint of their faces. High cheekbones, straight nose and front hair arranged in curled tassels reveal Gandhara affinity in this masterly crafted face.\nSimilar faces were depicted earlier in stone for instance, on the rear view of the central lintel of the north gate at Sanchi.

A growing need for personal rituals and portable shrines could have inspired the creation of such triptychs in different materials.\nDuring the 7th\u20138th centuries, particularly under the rule of King Lalitaditya (c. 699\u2013735 CE), Kashmir flourished as an important centre of art. Exposed to various currents of artistic expressions, through the brisk movements of the surrounding kingdoms in their power game, Kashmir emerged as a confluence of cultures and developed a distinctive Kashmiri art style. This triptych is one of the early examples of this style.\nThe ivory faithfully illustrates the scene of the miracle on mount Gridhrakuta narrated in the Saddharma Pundarika. The text gives a picturesque description of the event, \u201cThen did those who were assembled and sitting together in that congregation, monks, nuns, male and female lay devotees, gods, nagas, goblins, Gandharvas and demons, Garudas, kinnaras, the great serpent, men and beings not human, as well as governors of a region, rulers of armies and rulers of four continents, all of them with their followers, gaze on the Lord in astonishment, in amazement, in ecstasy. And at that moment there issued a ray from within the circle of hair between the eyebrows of the Lord.\u201d\nThe image represents a very interesting and meticulous account of the event. Buddha carved in deep relief is seated in Padmasana under a tri-foiled arched cave resting on gadrooned pillars. The sanghati covering his shoulders ends in beautiful pleats spreading over his knees. Typical of Kashmiri images of this period, the folds of the sanghati look like an open collar around the neck. The antarvastra or a tight-fitting garment underneath the sanghati covering his legs is clearly visible. His hair is tied in a bun and an urna is prominently marked on his forehead. His half-closed fish-shaped eyes, the pointed nose which is slightly broken now, and bow-shaped smiling lips are rendered in a style peculiar to this period in Kashmir. The throne bears figures of antelopes and a pair of lions below.\nHe is flanked on either side by six pairs of identical figures. These figures include two yakshas, two royal figures seated with folded hands and head bent down in adoration of the Buddha. The figures of the Gandharvas, two of whom are holding a flower or pearl trays, as well as the devotees, are seen peeping out of small spaces in between, eager to witness the miracle. Amazed by this sight, the two ascetics seated on top wearing matted locks on their head, have their eyes closed in deep ecstasy and express wonder with the gesture of their hand.\nTwo exquisite royal figures, though separately carved, belong to the same group and are placed as devotees on either side of the Buddha, standing elegantly facing him in a slight profile. The highly stylised posture of their hands is probably the depiction of the tantric form of a variant of namaskara mudra. As described by Geshe Kelsang Gyasto in his book Tantric Grounds and Paths, \u201cto do this (special mudra) we place our palms together in the mudra of prostration but leave the fingertips slightly apart, like the petals of a lotus flower starting to open, and tuck our thumbs inside to symbolise a precious jewel hidden within the lotus.\u201d Each king is also attended by a person with a tray full of flowers or pearls, a chauri bearer and another attendant.\nThe treatment of the siddhas is realistic. It is an imagistic narration where, in a limited given space encircling the main image, the artist has tried to depict the entire episode without following any sequence of events, just concentrating on the expression of the superhuman power of the Buddha. Each figure is carved with amazing minuteness, painstakingly avoiding any monotony.

His three-peaked tiara distinctly shows an image of the Dhyani Buddha as enjoined by the Sadhana-mala. He is wearing a prominent flower garment reaching right up to the ankles as is generally seen. He is decked with several ornaments such as the karna-phool, anklets, flowers tucked on top of the ears and necklaces. The mrigacharma tied in a reef knot in front of his chest covers his entire right shoulder. The ends of his dhoti reaching up to his knees are arranged between his legs in a chevron pattern. The curls of his hair fall down on his shoulders. The pedestal had an opening on the rear probably to keep the shasha as was customary with the Vajrayana Buddhists.\nGift from the Collection of Smt.

The Hassan inscription dated 1149 CE, is the earliest inscriptional record of the legend, describing the event in detail.\nThere are several versions of the incident which occurred at Sosavur (also known as Angadi) in the Kadur district in Karnataka. As cited in Gadag Inscription of Viba, Ballala II dated Saka Samvat 1114= 1192 CE, Sala was passing through the forest. An ascetic, terrified at the appearance of a lion called out hoysala (strike Sala) hearing which he slew the lion. Another version recorded in the Belur inscription 171, states, that when Sala was hunting along the slopes of the Sahya mountains of the Western ghats, he was astonished to see a hare pursuing a lion. Terrified of the lion the rishi called out poysala (strike Sala) and before it could step a span, Sala slew it with a dagger. This gave the Hoysalas their family name and their crest. Other versions describe Sala killing the lion with a rod of a cane or an iron.\nThe sculpture highlights the slaying of the lion by placing the King and the lion in the foreground. The might of the pouncing lion is vividly expressed by the amplification of his figure in proportion to the entire stele as also by highly stylised fierce claws, bulging eyes and wide open mouth. The King is fast advancing towards him in big strides with a raised straight and broad sword in his right hand, and a shield in his left. Two small boars near the king\u2019s leg and an elephant is seen behind the lion, profuse flora with trees and winding creepers all around on the sides and the top of the slab, suggest the forest.\nThe artist has depicted the earlier sequence of the King hunting in the forest by carving a smaller figure of the King on a richly caparisoned galloping horse behind, at a distance. The hunting dogs wearing collars around their necks are trying to attack the lion.\nThe ascetic, who was frightened by the animal, witnesses this feat of the king sitting on the branch of a tree in the right corner. His hair is tied straight behind in a bun and a short dhoti is the only garment covering his otherwise bare body. The king is adorned with various ornaments and a wig-like head-dress with peacock feathers carved in the centre. His pose is typical of many viragal heroes from Karnataka. The sculpture beautifully reveals how the quality of stone has facilitated the rhythmic flow of lines of the intricate design work as well as deep and smooth undercuts.\nCOLLECTION\nSculptures\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nDolerite\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\ndated 1070\nLOCATION\nBalligame, Karnataka\nDIMENSION\n58 x 105 x 17.5 cms.","687":"A Meditating Jina with Two Attendant Deities\n2009.638\nDESCRIPTION\nJina, literally meaning the conqueror, is the title of an enlightened being who is freed from the chain of rebirth.\nWhen it came to representing the 24 Jinas, the Jains did not distinguish them very clearly.

Though the image is compared to the Bapatla bronzes by Nihar Ranjan Ray, the modelling of tubular long legs, wide long eyes, and slightly pouting parched lips remind one of the Mohen-jo-Daro dancers. The snail-shell curls on his head and large eyes indicate its proximity to the early Mathura sculptures, whereas other features such as a slightly bulging abdomen and the coils of the snake attached to the image separately as an applique work, point to a more archaic origin. As suggested by U.P. Shah, it could indicate a continuation of the bronze casting techniques of the Indus Valley period up to the 2nd century BCE.\nParshvanatha stands in the Kayotsarga pose under the snake-hood spread around his head.

The Jain community was quick to undo its effects and engaged itself in intensive conservation activities, often recorded in the inscriptions from these areas.\nThe present two panels which are parts of Adinatha shrine show the donors worshipping the yaksha Gomukha (not illustrated) and yakshini Chakreshwari, the Shasanadevatas at the shrine of Adinatha. Yakshini Chakreshvari occupies a miniature shrine in the panel holding two chakras in her two upper hands. A miniature human figure is seated in front of her seat under her folded right leg. The other panel is its exact counterpart and depicts the bull-faced yaksha Gomukha with his mount elephant crouching under his seat. True to his iconographic form, he holds a goad, a noose and a citron in his three hands, while the remaining hand poses the varadamudra.\nThough the human figures are of standard portrait types, the rounded modelling and sensitively carved details make these images very lively. Both, Manikya and his wife are seated facing the yaksha and the yakshini, with slightly tilted heads and with hands stylishly folded in the front. Manikya wears his hair in a large bun and has a long beard, probably a custom with the shravakas as depicted in the sculptures and paintings of the early period. His wife is adorned with prominent circular earrings, hollow in the centre, which may be the traditional ornament of their community. The artist\u2019s ingenuity is expressed in the beautiful balloon-like curve of the odhani over the head of the female devotee in both sculptures. An identical representation of the odhani is seen in the paintings of the 12th-century Jain patlis from Western India.\nThe inscription mentions that the image of Adinatha in the Kanha-Vasahi was restored (jirnoddhara) by Manikya of the Pallivala family, the son of banker Ratna and Jamuna, for the merit of his father. The Jina image was consecrated by Sri Gunachandra of the Chaitra-gaccha. It is interesting that the same inscription is carved on both panels. The panels, therefore, do not seem to be a part of the pedestal of the image as is generally believed but probably occupied a place on either side of the entrance to the shrine.\nCOLLECTION\nJain Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nMarble\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nMarble carving\nDATE\nDated Samvat 1356=1299\nLOCATION\nLadol, Mehsana District, Gujarat\nDIMENSION\n30 x 61 x 10.5 cms.","694":"Mahavira\nS 116\nCOLLECTION\nJain Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nSlate\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n12th century CE\nLOCATION\nKarnataka\nDIMENSION\n124 * 44 * 25 cm","695":"Peacock\n22.2994\nDESCRIPTION\nA beautiful steel peacock from the same period which was perhaps carried on standards during religious processions is in the British Museum (1912,0716.1).

It was used mainly to fashion utilitarian and decorative objects like jewellery boxes, combs, hilts of swords and daggers. However, portrait figures in ivory are very rare. This portrait of Thirumala Nayaka is unique in this context.\nThirumala Nayaka, acclaimed for his heroism and love of art was one of the important Nayaka rulers of Vijayanagar (1623\u20131659). Though the empire was declining by this time, the Nayaka rulers left behind an architectural legacy, the most important of which is the holy temple of Madurai, Tamil Nadu.\nHere, Thirumala Nayaka stands gracefully on a high pedestal, richly adorned with jewellery, necklaces, large earrings, a broad waistband, bracelets and anklets. The transparent dhoti is probably brocaded, as traces of gold are evident. He has a sharply curved waist, stands with a slightly tilted head, and holds a dagger in his left hand.

Vishakhapattanam, a major port on the southern coast was an important centre of trade, particularly of ivory and shell work. As reported by J.K. Kippling in 1885 the jewel caskets made of ivory on tortoise shells were a speciality of Vishakhapattanam, the execution of which was delicate and their designs flawless.\nThe Vishakhapattanam artists seem to have mastered the technique of ivory carving. The technique employed is essentially the veneering technique and occasional fret work. Here the surface of the ivory is ornamented with designs in lac. The carved designs consist of mythological themes, animals, hunting scenes, fauna and flora. The carving of the figures is influenced by the Tanjore art style whereas the floral design all over the box bears a distinct European influence.\nThe box has delicately carved ivory panels on the tortoise shell and is one such example of excellent workmanship of Vishakhapattanam carving. The rectangular box has a complex structure. The inner side of the box is made of sandalwood, arranged in compartments suitable to hold jewellery pieces. The lid of each of these compartments is covered with a thin veneer of ivory painted with creeper designs. There is a figure probably of Krishna, holding a flute and snake entwined around his shoulder. The outer side made of tortoiseshell is covered with fretwork in ivory. The entire surface is covered with designs consisting of gods, goddesses, animals, birds as well as flora.\nThe top of the box has an elevated panel showing different designs, with a central oval panel depicting Harihara accompanied by a goddess seated on Nandi while the cows are placed in front against the beautifully carved backdrop, not easily visible to the naked eye. Of the two sages standing in salutation, one is Vyaghrapada with the legs of a tiger. The other one who is in the half human and half fish form, is Patanjali. Patanjali is believed to be an incarnation of the serpent Shesa and therefore, in later South Indian sculptures he is shown in the composite form with a human bust on top and a snake as the lower half. Vyaghrapada, a great devotee of Shiva, was provided with tiger legs to enable him to climb easily the thorny Bilwa trees to gather tender leaves for the worship of Shiva. Both of them were Shiva\u2019s ardent worshippers.\nThe lower elevation shows different ornamental scenes such as horse riders, dancers, hunting scenes etc. On one side of the top is a four-handed figure while the other shows a winged figure blowing a trumpet. The right side of the box has Sarasvati, while the opposite side has a scene depicting a human figure holding a trident and standing on a snake. The front and the rear sides of the box show a hunting scene and the episode of Hanuman carrying the mountain full of life-giving medicine, for Lakshmana. Two women elegantly hold up the decorated keyhole of the box in front.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Decorative Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nBox\nMATERIAL\nIvory on tortoise shell\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc. 1900 CE\nLOCATION\nVishakhapattanam, Andhra Pradesh\nDIMENSION\n16.6 x 36.7 x 27.8 cms.","709":"Vase in the form of an Incense Burner\n22.1015\nDESCRIPTION\nMark: seal \u201cTakasaki\u201d; carved inscription Bokusui hen, Inshi koku\nThis is a superb example of the collaboration among craftsmen of the Meiji period.

The dreaming deity is carved in high relief with details in applied copper, shakudo (an alloy of copper and gold which patinates to a luxurious black colour), and gold; the procession of the courtesans and her attendants on the reverse of the incense burner is executed in a similar technique.

They were important makers of armour and sword fittings, particularly sword guards (tsuba), for the ruling samurai families of the Edo period (c. 1600\u20131867).\nIn this time of relative peace their skill in the manufacture of flexible armour lent itself to the production of purely decorative articulated animals (jizai) using the same techniques of riveting metal plates as those employed on armour. The Myochin were especially skilled in the production of jizai and their many fanciful animals (dragons, sea creatures, insects, etc.) were in huge demand with wealthy samurai and the ascending merchant class of Japan\u2019s huge cities.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868 many of the Myochin School adapted the techniques formerly used to rivet metal to create armour, to now make feathers and scales. Jizai are amazingly flexible and can be moved into different positions; this snake, when held, moves in a most naturalistic way. We do not know precisely which Muneyoshi made this piece; there were a number of makers during the Edo period using this signature and one of the last of this name lived from 1852 to 1940 and exhibited his work at the Japan- British Exhibition at the White City, London in 1910.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nJapanese Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nDecorative Art Okimono\nMATERIAL\nIron with russet patination and inlaid gold eyes\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMeiji period\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc. 1875\nLOCATION\nJapan\nDIMENSION\nLength 161 cm","713":"Container for sweets\n22.800\nDESCRIPTION\nContainer for sweets in the shape of a cage of quail.

When Europe rediscovered Japanese print at the end of the 19th century, Hiroshige gave Western artists such as Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Van Gogh a new vision of nature.\nCOLLECTION\nJapanese Art\nARTIST\nHiroshige\nOBJECT TYPE\nWoodblock print\nMATERIAL\nink and colour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nEd\u014d period\nTECHNIQUE\nWoodblock printing\nDATE\n19th century CE\nLOCATION\nJapan\nDIMENSION\n--","734":"Spring Rain at Tsuchiyama\n22.1212\nDESCRIPTION\nSigned: \u201cDrawn by Hiroshige\u201d\nFrom the series Fifty-three Posting Stations the Tokaido\nPublisher: Takenouchi Magohachi (Hoeido)\nHiroshige started to produce landscape prints in the early 1830s. His unique style is evident in his series Famous Places in Edo and Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido. He continued to excel at views of famous places throughout his career.\nIn 1832, Hiroshige was invited to join an embassy of officials to the imperial court. En route, he studied the Tokaido road (eastern sea route), which wended its way along the shoreline from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Kyoto. His resulting series of prints of the Tokaido was extremely successful and his artistic reputation was firmly established. His woodblock prints of landscapes were incredibly influential not only in Japan but later in Europe, where his work influenced many artists of the Impressionist school. This print depicts the staging post of Tsuchiyama, a place situated in a mountain forest and known for its abundant spring rainfall.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nJapanese Art\nARTIST\nUtagawa Hiroshige\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting Woodblock print\nMATERIAL\nInk and colour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nEdo period\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1831\u20131834\nLOCATION\nJapan\nDIMENSION\n22.2 x 34.5 cms","735":"Vase\n31.13\nDESCRIPTION\nVase with Dish-shaped mouth.

This gu-shaped vase actually formed part of five offering vessels commonly found on Chinese altars. They consist of an incense burner, two candlesticks, and two vases. Many such sets were made in the Qianlong period, and they continued to be made in the Daoguang period when the grandson of the Qianlong emperor was the ruler of China.\nThe Eight Auspicious symbols first made their appearance as decorations on celadons and blue-and-white porcelain vessels of the Yuan dynasty. Originating from India, these symbols were most possibly introduced to China during the Yuan dynasty by Anige, the famous Newari artist of Nepal. Anige went to Dadu (Beijing) on the recommendation of the Sakya lama Phagpa, and he worked for Kublai Khan for many years.

Kraak wares are thinly potted and are characterised by chipped rims. Besides being made for export, they were also used domestically, examples of which have been excavated from tombs in the Jiangxi province with a range of dates from 1573 to 1645. Such wares were assumed to have been made at Jingdezhen but their exact places of production have yet to be reliably identified.\nIn 1603, the Dutch captured the carrack Catherina, which was carrying a rich cargo of silk, porcelain, and lacquer wares, in the Straits of Malacca. The cargo was sold for over three million guilders in Amsterdam and caused a sensation. Not only did such porcelain begin to appear in Dutch still-life paintings in the early 17th century C.E. but it also played a pivotal role in influencing the development of European pottery and was widely copied in pottery centres such as Delft.\nThe central panel of this plate shows peonies and chrysanthemums growing next to a Taihu rock, with bees hovering above.

He has been frequently represented in Nepali art and the history of the type of portrayal seen here can be traced back at least to the 5th century.\nOne of the earliest bodhisattvas in the Mahayana Buddhist pantheon, Avalokiteshvara (literally all-seeing lord) became a focus of independent worship in India as early as the Kushan period (1st\u20133rd century). Because his principal hand symbol is a lotus, he is also known as Padmapani. An embodiment of compassion, he is characterized as the \u201cSaviour of the World\u201d whose lotus hand extended in charity drips nectar of pity for all sentient beings.\nKarl & Meherbai Khandalavala Collection\nCOLLECTION\nHimalayan Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine\nMATERIAL\nGilt copper alloy\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\ncirca 1500\nLOCATION\nNepal\nDIMENSION\n--","760":"CHOVISI OF RISHABHANATHA\nB 42\nDESCRIPTION\nThis bronze image of a chovisi, meaning a group of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (Jain teachers), is an exquisite image of the Rashtrakuta period from the Deccan. The central figure is that of the first Jaina Tirthankara Rishabhanatha, standing erect in the meditative Kayotsarga posture. His broad chest is glowing with the golden shrivatsa mark indicative of his enlightened state.\nThe remaining twenty-three Tirthankaras are depicted in miniature on the parikara (aureole) around him. Parshvanatha seated in a niche in the topmost row is identifiable by the cobra-hood over his head. The parikara is surmounted by a canopy done in the typical style of the region. The Gandharvas (celestial musicians) and the apsaras (celestial dancers), standing in identical poses, create a beautiful pattern along the periphery of the parikara. The elegantly-dressed chauri (fly-whisk) bearers stand in the dvibhanga posture, with the left leg slightly bent. They are both on the sides of the main image. The lotuses emerging from the left and right of the pedestal provide the base for the chauri-bearers and also the seats for the attendants the yaksha Matanga and the yakshini Ambika. Matanga holds a citron in his right hand and a mongoose in his left, while Ambika, has a child seated on her left lap. She holds a twig of the mango tree in her right hand.

A favourite was that in which the naked toddler is shown dancing in joy holding a butter ball in his\nright hand. Symbolically the ball may also double as the universe, as it does in the hand of the adult Vishnu who is no different from Krishna. The pedestal with rings and the circular base make it clear that this was meant to be a processional image but without these supports the representation is remarkable for its naturalism and spontaneity.\nThe robust toddler with plump but muscular legs is given a belly bloated with the butter and other goodies he has consumed. He is naked except for various ornaments as befitting a child from an affluent family. Noteworthy is the necklace with a pair of tiger claws that he wears as a talisman. The only unnatural part of his anatomy is the profusion of his hair and its sophisticated arrangement into a crown, unlikely for his tender age. His posture too is that of an accomplished dancer rather than a prankster child. The step he takes with his right leg is expertly balanced by the graceful extension of his left arm, as if he has mastered the technique.\nCurious is the depiction of the pupils of his eyes in his boyish face that seem to make him squint. A sculpture of great charm and originality, this dancing figure of the jubilant butter thief remains a fascinating realisation of the lively theme by an unknown master sculptor of a Karnataka workshop at the height of the Vijayanagara empire, perhaps under the great monarch Achyutaraya (1529\u201342).\nCOLLECTION\nSculptures\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nBronze\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nVijayanagara period\nTECHNIQUE\nLost Wax\nDATE\n15th century CE\nLOCATION\nBellary district, Karnataka dist.,\nDIMENSION\n42 cm.","762":"Trivikrama\nB 68.1\nDESCRIPTION\nA FORM OF VISHNU\nVishnu manifested himself in twenty-four forms. These forms are identified by the order of the ayudhas (emblems) placed in his four hands. Here, Vishnu stands in Samapadasthanaka (straight) pose on a circular lotus resting on a pedestal. He holds a mace in the upper right hand, a disc in the upper left hand and a conch in the lower left hand. The lower right hand is in the varada, (boon-bestowing) mudra. By the positions of the different emblems held in his hands, this bronze can be identified as the Trivikrama form of Vishnu.\nAccording to the story, Bali the king of the Asuras extended his authority over the three worlds inflicting an overall defeat on the gods. Vishnu assumed the form of Vamana (dwarf) and approaching Bali, asked him to give him as much space as could be measured by three of his footsteps. Bali agreed to this. Vishnu then enlarged himself to such a great size that he covered the two worlds with his two steps. Then he questioned Bali about the third step. Bali offered his head: Vishnu stepped on it and pushed him to Patal Loka (hell). Thereafter, Vishnu was known as Trivikrama.\nNotice the three-pointed mukuta (crown), karna-kundalas (earrings), bajuband (armlets), Kada (bracelets), necklaces, yajnopavita (sacred thread), katisutra (girdle of the waist), and uru dama (thigh jewellery). The decorative vanamala (flower garland) hangs from the shoulders to the knees. Vishnu is flanked by Shridevi and Sarasvati.\nWe see Sarasvati as his consort only in Eastern Indian sculptures. Elsewhere Sarasvati is replaced by Bhudevi. Behind Vishnu\u2019s head is a leaf-shaped halo.

This myth is symbolically represented in the form of Sheshashayi Vishnu. This image is distinguished by a unique composition and a very sensitive treatment of this particular theme. Quite unlike the other Sheshashayi Vishnu images lying straight on the coils of Serpent Ananta, in this sculpture he is slightly turned to his right supporting his head with his upper right hand. The serpent-hood is also slightly turned to the right to be exactly above Vishnu\u2019s head. The centre of the serpent-hood aligns exactly with the top left corner of the slab deviating noticeably from other sculptures where it is generally in the centre of the panel. As his hands are resting comfortably on the Adishesha, his emblems the chakra and Gada are placed horizontally on the bed near his right hand, while shankha is near his left hand. Shri Devi and Bhudevi are seated by his side and the winged Garuda in the right corner is standing in adoration of the god. Mutilated figures of Madhu and Kaitabha are placed on the top. Vishnu is adorned with Kiritamukuta, Yajnopavita, armlets, bracelets, and a necklace popularly known as optimal or necklace of coins.

As narrated in the Mahabharata, the nagas, the children of Kadru, cheated Garuda\u2019s mother Vinata and enslaved her. They agreed to restore her freedom provided Garuda brought them the nectar from Indra. Garuda performed many feats and reached the place where the pot of nectar was kept. Two rotating wheels protected the pot and below the wheels were two monstrous serpents.

The rectangular Gauripatta, the receptacle on which the image has been installed has an outlet to drain out the ablution water. As daily ablutions are implied, the image must have been made for the main shrine of a small temple.\nShiva and Parvati are standing side by side, passing an arm on each other\u2019s shoulder in an embrace. Shiva\u2019s face is carved in three-quarter profile as he looks at the face of Parvati. Out of the other three hands, his two upper arms hold the trident and the damaru, while his lower right hand holds an akshamala. Parvati holds a lotus in her left hand. Richly ornamented figures, with beautiful jatabhara of Shiva and coiffure of Parvati, make them appear like a royal couple.

This is a simplification of the earlier lotus pedestals which now take the shape of an ordinary furniture. This kind of pedestal however, became popular in Karnataka and Maharashtra.\nThe Kanarese inscription on the pedestal states that the image was a gift of Revakabbarasi, the wife of Vavanarasa, a feudatory of the western Chalukya king Jayasimha II (1015\u201342 CE).\nCOLLECTION\nSculptures\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nDolerite\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n11th century CE\nLOCATION\nKarnataka\nDIMENSION\n113 x 93 x 49 cms.","768":"DVARAPALA\nS 577\nDESCRIPTION\nTHE sculpture must have originally occupied the left side niche of the base of the door jamb of a lost temple of Shiva at Shamalaji.

He stands stretching his right leg a little, giving a graceful tilt to his body and the curled folds of his dhoti near his waist support his relaxing left hand. The Trishula held in his right hand is supported vertically on the ground, while the serpent around his shoulders is looking around as if exploring the surrounding environment. The ornaments, folds of the dhoti, the mukuta and the tassels of his hair, as also the details of the mountain with indications of trees, are meticulously carved, giving a distinctive appearance to each of these details, on this fine-grained schist. Though the proportion of the left arm is slightly distorted, the artist shows remarkable mastery over the modelling of the body contours, the fleshy roundness of the chest, the abdomen and the loins and creating rhythmic patterns by gentle curves wherever possible, as seen in the postures of the attendants who reflect the rhythm of the main figure.

He holds a lotus and a bowl in his upper hands, while the lower left is in vitarka mudra and the lower right rests on his knee positioned in the varada mudra. Vitarka mudra is particularly associated with Dakshinamurti, who is the embodiment of Knowledge. The thumb and the pointing finger brought together as in the vitarka mudra suggest the ultimate oneness of the jivatman with the Paramatma as explained by Sayana in his commentary on the Dakshinamurti stotra.\nShiva is seated in Lalitasana, his body gracefully bent in dvibhanga. Dakshinamurti on Nandi seems to be a local iconographic development of eastern India which may have emerged following the popular Buddhist form of Simhanada Lokesvara or Yamari.

Shri Hirananda Shastri is mainly guided by a few decipherable letters of a much later inscription on its pedestal identified as an image of Sadashiva. This pedestal was found lying just in front of the image of Brahma. The reading of the inscription, however, is not certain as the letters are not quite legible. Also one cannot ignore the fact that Shiva, who is a yogi is unlikely to be carved a pot-bellied figure as represented in this image. The possibility of it being an image of Brahma is also strengthened by the presence of the paw of a swan, the mount of Brahma, on this fragmented pedestal.\nOnly the four faces and the bust of this life-size image have survived. He is adorned with various ornaments, a necklace, hollow-cast earrings, a torque, and a thick necklace and also wears the skin of an antelope and yajnopavita on his shoulder. The design of his moulded earrings has continued till today. Similar earrings are occasionally seen worn by some Koli women of this area who still prefer traditional ornamentation.\nThe image is carved in the round only up to the lower part of the neck of the rear side. The artist has carved a smooth vertical slab at the back, probably to fix the image on vertical support. This is the only known figure from Elephanta which is carved in the round and is to be seen from all four sides. Hence, it is probable that the sculpture was installed in the shrine for the devotees to do pradakshina or circumambulation.\nThere are diverse opinions on the original placement of this image at Elephanta. Evidence indicate that it was installed in the main shrine which is occupied at present by a Shiva linga. There are reasons to believe that this could have been a well-known shrine of Brahma at Elephanta. The shrine of Brahma at Puri (Gharapuri) must have been so important and sacred that King Dantidurga refers to his pilgrimage to the Brahma temple at Puri, among one his important religious acts in the Manor inscription.

As narrated in the Devi Mahatmya, sometime after the Great Goddess Durga killed Mahishasura, the gods approached her to kill the two mighty demons Shumbha and Nishumbha who had collected a huge army of several fierce demons and were terrorising the gods. When the fight ensued, they sent their generals one after the other to defeat the Goddess. When their powerful generals Chanda and Munda advanced towards her with their army, she turned dark with anger and created Kali, out of her eyebrows, to kill both of them.\nKali was given the name Chamunda by the Great Goddess herself when she slew Chanda and Munda. During the same battle, Chamunda also performed a horrific act of drinking the blood of the demon Raktabija, each drop of whose blood could give instantaneous birth to mighty demons, if fallen on the earth.\nShe is supposed to have a terrible countenance, gaping mouth with fangs, lolling tongue and deep sunken eyes. Though in the Devi Mahatmya itself she is armed only with a sword and a noose, later texts endow her with multiple arms. She enjoys a prominent position particularly in the Tantric rituals.\nThe image is a powerful representation of Chamunda, seated on a pedestal resting her left foot on a corpse, holding vajra, damaru, khadga, akshamala, khatwanga and kapala in her six hands, the remaining two being broken. She looks fierce with her two fangs jutting out of the corners of her mouth and her bulging eyes. Flames emanating from her head form a halo. Probably following the characteristic of Shiva images, she also wears earrings of two different designs in her ears. She is also adorned with a necklace, armlets, udarbandha, kamarbandh and anklets. The details of the ornaments are sparse but her rounded body emanates considerable feminine charm.\nCOLLECTION\nSculptures\nOBJECT TYPE\nSculpture\nMATERIAL\nGranite\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n11th Century CE\nLOCATION\nTamil Nadu\nDIMENSION\n87 x 61 x 34 cms.","789":"Mithuna\n66.22\nDESCRIPTION\nThe pair of male and female in Indian art has a much wider connotation than just sexual or procreative partners.

The hero Heracles broke off the horn in combat with Achelous who was fighting in the form of a bull.

The hilt has a broad plate guard and wide finger guard which joins the round flat pommel. A slanting spike on the pommel could have acted as a hand rest. The plate guard and the finger guard are padded while the grip is covered with leather. A Sword knot or the sword guard was attached to the sword to avoid the loss of the weapon during combat. Before drawing out the sword the hand was slipped through the loop to grip the hilt so that even if the weapon slipped from the hand it remained hanging on the wrist. The inscription on the sword reads: Sikada Shah Khalji Allauddin Sultan. This inscribed sword of Alauddin Khilji is perhaps the earliest available historical sword in the country.\nSir Ratan Tata Collection\nCOLLECTION\nArms and Armour\nOBJECT TYPE\nSwords\nMATERIAL\nSteel with gold damascene\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nEarly 14th century\nLOCATION\nDelhi, North India\nDIMENSION\nL: 101 cms.","820":"Shield of Emperor Akbar\n22.4112\nDESCRIPTION\nThis grand shield belonged to Emperor Akbar. It is made of high quality watermark steel and has detailed damascene work in gold.The Ain-i-Akbari mentions four kinds of shields \u2013 sipar, dhal, khera, and pahri. This is a sipar, which was common in Mughal India. Sipar is a Persian name for a shield made of steel or hide, generally from 43 to 60 cm in diameter. If made of steel, the shields were often, as here, ornamented with patterns in gold.\nThe decorations on this shield run in three circular bands, with an effulgent sun in the centre and four damascened bosses around it. Between the upper and the leftside boss there is an inscription placed in a star, which reads: \u201cBuland Iqbal Shahinshah Akbar ah 1002 [1593 ce]\u201d.\nThe immediate band around the centre has a bold meandering pattern. Going outward, the next band has realistic representations of the twelve Zodiac signs,each with its corresponding oval label. Interestingly the human figures in the signs of Gemini, Virgo, and Aquarius are shown in European costume, which led some scholars to ascribe a later date to this shield. However, it is possible that this foreign element could have been copied from European engravings that were presented to Emperor Akbar. It should be noted here that some early paintings of Akbar\u2019s period reflect an awareness of European art. In some of the paintings from the Tutinama (c. 1560\u201365 ce) several figures wear European costume.\nBoth Ain-i-Akbari and Akbarnama mention Akbar\u2019s great interest in Indian astrology. Besides, Akbar\u2019s faith in the sun was demonstrated in the new religion he founded, Din-e-ilahi. Abul Fazl records in the Ain-i-Akbari: \u201cAn order was given that the sun should be worshipped four times a day in the morning and evening and at noon and mid-night. His Majesty had also one thousand and one Sanscrit names of the sun collected and read them daily, devoutly turning towards the sun\u2026.\u201d Emperor Akbar considered the sun auspicious, sacred, and beneficial to all, particularly to a ruler.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nArms and Armour\nOBJECT TYPE\nArms\nMATERIAL\nSteel with gold damascene\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMughal\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1593 CE\nLOCATION\nIndia\nDIMENSION\nDiameter 52 cm","821":"Deshasevika\n78.6\/148\nDESCRIPTION\nIn the early twentieth century, hundreds of new textile mills began to emerge in India.

The left corner of the painting shows them assembled in the woods. And so have the gopis on the balcony on the right. The gopis have long awaited the glimpse of their beloved Krishna and the artist has captured that moment when they exchange quick glances with him as he passes by. The youthful Krishna, wearing wooden sandals, holding a cowherd stick and adorned with a long flower garland\nlooks up at the two gopis, one of whom may be Radha. His face is highlighted by a halo around it. His companion, unable to comprehend the situation, looks at him in amazement. Even today, the Godhuli Bela (The Hour of Cow Dust) is considered an auspicious moment.\nThe hour of cow dust is particularly celebrated on Gopashtami, the eighth day of the bright half of Kartika (November) when everybody worships the cows returning from the fields at twilight.

The painting depicts the emperor seated in the front quadrangle, leading to the holy deg (cauldron). Poor people are gathered around the deg, from which food is served to them.

They are written in Sanskrit and are known as the Amarushataka. Amaru composed these lyrics sometime during the late 7th or early 8th Century CE. These verses depict the expressions of love under various circumstances like quarrels, separation, reconciliation, and the reunion of lovers. The picturisation of the sentiments expressed in the lyrics is vivid and charming. The figures are set against a dark background of red, black or green. Black is used effectively, sometimes for the sky and sometimes for the architectural space to provide a background to the human figures.\nThe harsh monotony of the dark colours is occasionally relieved by a few stars or chirpy white birds and sometimes by the foliage in front. This painting depicts the moment of separation between the hero and the heroine. The hero declares his mission of going to far-away lands, leaving her to face the agony of parting and the uncertainty of the future. The hero, dressed in the attire of a warrior, is armed with a large shield, sword and a long lance. He consoles the heroine with a gesture of the right hand. The heroine\u2019s gesture indicates her reluctant acceptance of the situation. Both stand in a garden pavilion, decorated with turrets, domes and arches typical of the Malwa style.

As a result, a new sub-style of Rajasthani paintings emerged which came to be known as the Thikana Paintings. This painting depicts Maharawat Naharsingh, the ruler of Deogarh, seated on the terrace with his wife Champavatji enjoying a dance performance.\nThe elegantly dressed Champavatji has a brocaded odhani (veil) around her head. The beautifully spread pleats of her skirt exhibit a rich brocade work. Naharsingh, dressed in royal attire, is seated in the centre of the carpet. He holds a small wine cup in his right hand and flowers in his left. The emerald and pearl sarpech (a decoration for headgear) and a black feather decorating his turban indicate his royal position. Vadaran Kasturi (female attendant) dressed in an orange sari stands behind him with a tray and a chuski (silver liquor decanter). A female guard holds the sword and the shield of the Maharawat.

It is time for Krishna to approach his beloved Radha who, clad in a lovely green full-sleeved dress with an ample skirt, is awaiting Krishna, coyly arranging her ornaments. On this starlit night, she prepared a bed of leaves and decorated it with flowers. She seems a little ill at ease in the great expectation of the approaching moment. On the other side, Duti, the messenger is signalling to Krishna to go to Radha. She is dressed in a green and orange skirt and has wrapped a transparent golden odhani around her. Their graceful movements, their ornaments particularly the ear ornament, sprays of flowers on the trees and thick but well-balanced vegetation, and several pairs of birds reflecting the mood of the time, mirror the artistic achievements of Kangra paintings of the late 18th century.\nThe moods of Radha and Krishna are projected in the classification of Nayak and nayika\u2013 hero and heroine. The nayikabheda (moods of heroine) is referred to in Gita Govinda and classified extensively by Keshavadasa in Rasikpriya. The nayika who is waiting for the lover to arrive is called Vasaksajja which means a nayika who has prepared her bed. Another folio of this series is in the K.P.

Allegorically this human relationship refers to the aspiration of the soul for the Supreme. The theme is systematically dealt with in the famous poem Rasikapriya by Keshavadasa who lived in Orcha, Madhya Pradesh in the 16th century. This painting is inspired by Rasikapriya as indicated by an inscription on the reverse referring to the twenty-third verse of the seventh chapter of the Rasikapriya of Keshavadasa.\nOn a moonlit night, the heroine has dressed up with jewellery. The bed of banyan leaves is prepared under a green tree on the bank of a river, and after eagerly waiting for her lover through the night, she is now discarding all her ornaments in despair; because he betrayed her. Her pinkish complexion, thick locks of hair falling over her neck almost reaching her knees, her firm circular breasts, elongated eyes deeply engrossed in thought and sharply curved eyebrows lend an unusual charm to this painting.\nDescribing the Vipralabdha Nayika, Keshavadasa writes:\nVipralabdha is a nayika who is dejected.\nThis night the nayaka being absorbed in some work of his did not come,\nWhere at the flowers seemed to her darts, And perfumed things with evil stunk!\nHer house a parcher\u2019s oven seemed, Gardens to fearful forests turned,\nLike fever was the cool moonbeams, Which all her body seemed to burn!\nSongs were abuse, and betels made, Looked to her as if they poison were!\nAnd all sixteen adornments appeared As if they merely were embers!\nSir Ratan Tata Collection\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\nIndian Miniature painting\nDATE\nEarly 19th century CE\nLOCATION\nGarhwal, Uttarakhand\nDIMENSION\nFull page: 21.5 x 28.5 cms.

Though the theme is European, the setting is partially Mughal. The wall decoration and the front railing indicate the typical Mughal chamber while St. Joseph, trying to push aside a huge drape to allow sufficient light for St. Anne to behold the divine Child is true to the prototype. The heavily brocaded costume of Mary and a tilaka mark on her forehead cannot be missed as strikingly Indian elements. It is quite a challenge for the artist to introduce the figure of an angel in the small space behind the mother and the Child.\nConsiderable charm is added to the painting by rendering it in the Nim qalam, using only white contrasting with gold.\nIt is mounted on a beautiful large mount painted with floral motifs in gold.\nAnother derivation from the same painting is in the Nasser Khalili collection, but it is considerably changed to suit the Mughal artist\u2019s imagination.\nFrom the Muraqqa of Nana Phadnis\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque watercolour and gold on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMughal\nTECHNIQUE\nMiniature Painting\nDATE\n1620\u20131630 CE\nLOCATION\n--\nDIMENSION\nFull page: 33.3 x 55.4 cms.

The border is decorated with a band of scallop shells and three trefoil panels, each with a winged cherub.\nAphrodite, the Greek goddess of love (known to the Romans as Venus) is depicted at the moment of her birth. According to Hesiod she was born from the foam (aphros in Greek) and emerged fully grown. The story relates that Cronos cut off the genitals of his father, Uranus, and threw them in the sea. The foam gathered around them and was transformed into a woman. When Aphrodite came to land she was attended by Eros (Cupid to the Romans) who is perhaps represented by the cherubic figures around the border.\nThis plate is a remarkable example of cameo glass, in which the plain dark glass is applied with a layer of white glass (in this case about 1 mm thick).

Distinctly conservative, historicist even, the design owes much to the sorts of ornamental vases produced at the French royal factory of S\u00e8vres during the 1760s and 1770s. The crisp modelling, the landscape painting, the rich blue ground, and the gilding, all seek to emulate S\u00e8vres, although the elaborate tendril-like double handles reflect early 19th-century style too.\nSir D.J.

This is pictorially expressed with the miniature paintings based on the poetic expressions.\nKakubha Ragini, a wife of Megha Raga, has the mood of a heroine deserted by her lover. Holding two lotus flower garlands, Kakubha wanders sadly in a grove with two peacocks, whose plaintive cries would have been understood as echoing her feelings of dejection.\nRaga (Sanskrit, color or passion) is the term for a classical music mode, a set framework for improvisation. Having originated in the first millennium, ragas were systematized and classified during the thirteenth through sixteenth century, they were classified into ragamalas, meaning garlands of musical modes. A common system recognized six raga husbands, each \"married\" to five ragini wives for a total of thirty-six \"families.\" Families of musical modes sometimes included sons or ragaputras as well. By the fifteenth century, ragas had become associated with specific moods, times, seasons, affective properties, deities, lovers, and heroes. Around 1590-1620, illustrated ragamala series became a favorite subject for Rajput patrons, as well as for some Mughals, such as Abdur Rahim, patron of the Freer Ramayana and the Laud Ragamala. Specific iconographies were developed for depicting each mode. These formulae lent themselves to variations, which were sometimes dependent on region.\nIllustrated ragas evoke mood and engender feeling, as do musical compositions. But the connection seems to be indirect. Although some connoisseurs of music may have internally \"heard\" a composition when viewing its image, ragamalas were probably more broadly valued for their poetic and pictorial pleasures. The commission of a ragamala series would also have been understood as a sign of a patron's cultivated sensibility.\nA gift of Sir Akbar Hydari .\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque water colour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nMid 17th Century CE\nLOCATION\nDeccani, Golkonda\nDIMENSION\n15.5 x 9.5 cms","859":"Goddess killing demon Chanda\n56.38 F 31\nDESCRIPTION\nObverse of Folio 31 from the illustrated manuscript of Devi Mahatmya\nThe Devi Mahatmya of Markandeya Purana is probably the most popular text copied and illustrated in all parts of India for religious merit as well as for reading and recitation.

The Persians consider dogs impure and therefore employ birds for hunting purposes.\nShah Abbas II was the seventh Shah of Safavid Iran. He lived a very affluent lifestyle and also maintained a royal atelier. He gave patronage to both Iranian and Dutch painters and encouraged Iranian painters to learn the European painting style. He had diplomatic relations with the Mughals and Qandhahar was the primary point of conflict between them.\nThe present painting seems to be a Mughal copy of an Iranian painting. Nils Mattsson Kioping, a swede traveler who visited Iran at the time of Shah Abbas II writes \u201c For hunting, he (Shah Abbas II) uses falcons, among which is a white raven with a red beak, which is as swift in striking birds as the falcon. He also has two hundred leopards that have been trained so that no game in the fields or forests can pass them by without their catching it in three leaps\u2026..In his state where the royal horses are fed, and which are one hundred in numbers, there is exceptional cleanliness\u2026They are covered with the finest golden cloth and their vessels are of fine Arabian gold.\u201d (Travelogue and autobiography 1647-1657, Nils Mattssons Kioping, KVHAA handlingar historiska series 39, pp 77-78).\nFalconry or hawking, a form of hunting was a popular sport amongst Kings and noblemen in medieval times. This form of hunting was viewed more as a means of entertainment. Falconers raised the young birds usually falcons, hawks, and eagles, and trained them to hunt small birds and animals like partridges, cranes, and hares.\nArtists drew and painted many varieties of falcon portraits during the times of Jahangir (r. 1605- 27). Mughal emperors had a separate department for the royal hawk and the employees. The baz namas are treatises or books that contain detailed chapters on ways to keep the hawks healthy and treat their diseases.\nBefore the turn of the 16th century, Iran went through a devastating period due to Turkish and Mongol invasions. The peaceful rule of the Safavid dynasty (1499-1736) brought about the revival of the passion for hawking and hunting.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque water colour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMughal\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nEarly 18th Century CE\nLOCATION\n--\nDIMENSION\n25 x 16.3 cms (without border)","874":"Venugopala\n2009.372\nDESCRIPTION\nThe painting depicts Krishna as Venugopala where he is shown playing his beloved musical instrument flute.

Exorcism or the ritualistic act of driving out evil spirits is a special type of faith healing.\nExorcism has a long history in various cultures around the world. This 18th-century painting raises a very crucial issue of superstitions and the status of mental health in rural society. Even after the gap of 200 years after the creation of this painting and the progress in education, science, and health care this evil is still present in some pockets of India. In many of rural areas, diseases like epilepsy, depression, or mental disorder are seen as the cause of possession by evil spirits and are treated with the help of priests. The victims are more often females.\nA few of the possible reasons for this misconception could be the fear of social stigma, a lack of awareness, gender bias, the high cost of treatment, and a strong belief in good or bad spirits which stops people to take appropriate medical help or concealing.\nKarl and Meherbai Khandalavala Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nOpaque water colour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBundi\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1760-1770 CE\nLOCATION\nRajasthan\nDIMENSION\n16.5 x 24.5 cms.","902":"Worship of Shiva Parvati on Kailash\n2009.376\nDESCRIPTION\nThe painting set against a green background shows a five-headed Shiva seated on a full-bloomed lotus along with his consort Parvati.

There is a mention in the Bhagavata Purana where Krishna says \u201c My stories should be sung, danced and enacted on festive occasions\u201d. (XI. 27.44).\nPhilosophically the most important dance of Krishna is Rasamandala (Raas Lila), meaning circle of delight or ecstasy. The love of gopis and Krishna takes place in a circle that has neither beginning nor an end and goes on and on for eternity. During the dance, Krishna multiplies himself and dances with all the gopis simultaneously. He thus convinces them that he participates in their lives, giving freely of himself to each and everyone and ensuring that he is lovingly and completely available to his devotees. The dance leads the gopis to the path of liberation where the individual soul (Jivatman) joins the divine soul (Patmatman).\nThe present painting depicts the Rasa Leela where Radha and Krishna are shown seated on a full-bloomed lotus in the centre. Krishna is playing the flute and Radha is holding a pink lotus in her hand. They are encircled by Krishna and gopis playing rasa.

Though not a Tirthankara Bahubali is worshipped by the Jains as an enlightened soul and is revered for his severe austerities. He is worshipped in Maharashtra and Karnataka by the Digambara sect of Jainism.\nThe iconography of Bahubali is derived from biographical details which centre round his austerities. Rishabhanatha left his kingdom to his son Bharata who in order to be on Chakravarti, entered into a duel with his brother Bahubali. As the name suggests Bahubali was a strong man, he lifted Bharata and flung him down twice. As he was going to do the same the third time, wisdom overpowered him and he realised the futility of the worldly power. He gently put down his brother and went to the forest to practice austerities to attain Kevlar Gyana (omniscience).\nHe performed such severe penance that he was surrounded by ant - hills and creepers wound around his legs and spread all over his body.\nThe depictions of Bahubali in sculptures and paintings show him in standing posture with creepers spread on his body. The 65 feet high Bahubali or Gomateshwara sculpture at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka is an excellent example of this. In present painting also he is depicted in same posture which is known as Kayotsarga pose with creepers spread on his body.\nGift of Shri.

It is described in the Bhagavata Purana X, 33, 24-40 how, during the Rasalila, Krishna entered the waters of the Yamuna, and \u201csported here like a king elephant as he was profusely sprinkled over with water on all sides by the youthful damsels who were casting amorous glances at him and were laughing heartily while he was being praised by the gods who were showering on him flowers from their aerial cars\u201d. Later at Brahma muhurta (early morning), the gopis reluctantly returned home.\nThis folio of a Bhagavata Purana manuscript elaborately painted at Nagpur illustrates the episode. It is a full moon night in Vrindavan, the trees are in full bloom, and the clear blue waters of the Yamuna in the foreground are full of pink\nlotuses. The Blue God, dressed as usual in his pitambara with a golden border, a long white vanamala, and a morapichha in his mukuta, is encircled by the gopis dressed in colourful garments. All of them are standing partially submerged in the river. They spray water at Krishna in delightful amorous sport. The blue water turns into tiny white drops as it splashes against Krishna. In return, he also throws water on the faces of two gopis. The four gopis standing on the bank behind the trees seem to be looking for Krishna or are returning home.\nThe manuscript in long horizontal format is important for an understanding of the Nagpur style of painting.

While Indra\u2019s role diminished in classical Hinduism, he held an important place in Buddhism, as head of the Buddhist deities residing on Mount Meru in the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods and also as chief of the indigenous spirits, or nats, often classed together as the Thirty-seven Lords. He is generally shown standing, holding in one hand his three- or four-sided sword, and dressed as a Burmese king during the Konbaung period (1752\u20131885). In some depictions, he holds a tablet and a pen or stylus, emblematic of his role as one who records rights and wrongs accumulated through life and rewards or punishes individuals accordingly. Sakka appears in the early Buddhist murals of Pagan, usually holding a conch, another of his major attributes. At the famous Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, life-size figures of Thagyamin surround the base of the pagoda. Thagyamin is often paired in art with Brahma, another deity dear to the Pali pantheon.

If consist of an elegantly attired woman who connotes the goddess Lakshmi with a lamp in her hands. Dipa Lakshmi is generally shown standing on a lotus or elephant. In some part of India there is practice of gifting Dipa Lakshmi on elephant to newly wed daughters at festival time to bestow prosperity and fertility on her.\nOne of the most important milestones in the history of mankind is the discovery of fire. It has played a very crucial role in the progress and development of man and therefore, in India, fire and lamps are considered very auspicious.\nIn earlier times, lamps were perhaps only wicks lit in hollows or shallow depressions in stone. Later on, lamps were made of sea shells, clay and various metals like brass, copper and silver. In the \u2018Ramayana\u2019 and the \u2018Mahabharata\u2019 there are references to lamps made of gold. The earliest lamp was simple - a small bowl made of clay with a beak-like projection, popularly known as Panti. Interestingly, this type of lamp is found in India as early as the Harappan period (3300 BCE to 1800 BCE) and continues till this date!\nIn India, lamp symbolizes the human body and flame symbolizes the soul. Thus the individual is a Deepak (lamp) and the soul is a jeevan jyoti (the flame of life). Indians believe, that the soul is immortal. Even after the death of a person, a lamp is lit to guide the departing soul into the other world.\nAt every stage of life therefore, lamps are lit to celebrate the eternal life force. In earlier times special lamps were lit at coronation ceremonies, on the return of a victorious warrior and at every other important occasion. The aarti (ritualistic adoration with lighted lamps) is performed even today to strengthen and establish relationship between man and God, brother and sister, wife and husband, mother and child. Ancient texts mention Deepadaan (gifting of lamp) as a act of high merit. There are several festivals connected with lamps \u2013 Deep Amavasya (July \u2013 August), Diwali (October \u2013 November) and Ganga poojan which are celebrated with great pomp.\nWith the passage of time there has been innovation in the types and shapes of lamps meant for different occasions and requirement.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Decorative Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nLamp\nMATERIAL\nBrass\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nEarly 20th Century CE\nLOCATION\n--\nDIMENSION\n--","984":"Animal Figure\nF 180\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine\nMATERIAL\nTerracotta\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","985":"Double Pot\nF 144\nDESCRIPTION\nNA\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nPot\nMATERIAL\nBaked Clay\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nCirca 4200-1100 BCE\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","986":"probably Fertility Figurine\nF 143\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine\nMATERIAL\nBlack Clay\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","987":"Mother Goddess\nF 142\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nFigurine\nMATERIAL\nTerracotta\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","988":"Painted Pot\nF 141\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nPot\nMATERIAL\nTerracotta\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","989":"Stand\nF 140\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nPottery\nMATERIAL\nTerracotta\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","990":"Jug\nF 135\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nUtensil\nMATERIAL\nTerracotta\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","991":"Jug\nF 134\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nUtensil\nMATERIAL\nTerracotta (Glazed)\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n--\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","992":"Flask\nF 133\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nUtensil\nMATERIAL\nBaked Clay\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nCirca 4200-1100 BCE\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","993":"Lamp\nF 123\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nAncient Civilisations\nOBJECT TYPE\nLamp\nMATERIAL\nBaked Clay with Pigments (Probably)\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nElamite Period\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nCirca 4200-1100 BCE\nLOCATION\nSusa\nDIMENSION\n--","994":"Head of a Damsel\n72.6\nDESCRIPTION\nThis terracotta head is probably that of a dancer.

The elephant who has broken off all the four chains is running ahead and is being driven into an arched entrance probably that of a tent with the help of the tamed one following behind. The attendants hold burning sticks, known as charkhi to frighten the animal.\nThe inscription on the top left corner mentions that the elephants Bhalerao and Anup belong to Rao Surjan (1554\u20131583 CE). Various contours of the elephant are effectively rendered with masterly brushwork and shading against the background of the plain paper. It is tinted in places and was probably intended to be partially painted, particularly in the costumes of the human figures. The painting is obviously not contemporary. The study of elephants in different actions was done by the Bundi artist as early as the 17th century, evidence of which still survives at the Badal Mahal murals at Bundi.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nInk and Tempera on Paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nRajasthani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1725\nLOCATION\nKota, Rajasthan\nDIMENSION\n26.5 x 54 cm","1021":"Watersport\n2009.352\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc.1790 CE\nLOCATION\nNurpur, Kangra, Himchal Pradesh\nDIMENSION\n23.6x33 cms.","1022":"Balwant Singh with courtiers\n2009.147\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nc. 1750 CE\nLOCATION\nJammu\nDIMENSION\n30.8x20.5","1023":"Equestrian portrait of Raja Bhoj\n2009.43\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nRajasthani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1680 CE\nLOCATION\nBundi, Rajasthan\nDIMENSION\n21x26.3 cms.","1024":"Duti talking to Krishna\n2009.8\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1730 CE\nLOCATION\nBasohli, Jammu & Kashmir\nDIMENSION\n30.8x20.6 cms.","1025":"Rukmini proceeding to the temple\n63.6\nDESCRIPTION\nScene from the Mahabharata- Rukmini proceeding to the temple of Devi.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1760 CE\nLOCATION\nKangra, Himachal Pradesh\nDIMENSION\n29x19.6 cms (without border)","1026":"Raja smoking hookah\n61.19\nDESCRIPTION\n--\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nPahari\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nEarly 18th century CE\nLOCATION\nBasohli, Jammu & Kashmir\nDIMENSION\n16.6x28 cms (without border)","1027":"Ram, Lakshman & Sita\n56.28\nDESCRIPTION\nOne illustrated folio from a manuscript of the Ramayana- Rama Lakshmana and Sita in the hermitage of Bharadwaj.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\n--\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMughal\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\ncirca 1610 CE\nLOCATION\nDelhi\nDIMENSION\n29.1x20 cm","1028":"The breaking of the bow\n54.1\/16 Folio 66\nDESCRIPTION\nIllustration from MSS of Ramayana\nThe scene lay within the palace compound with tents.

The art of sandalwood carving in the Shimoga district of Mysore was practised by a community known as Gudigars. They were supposed to have migrated from Goa during the Portuguese occupation. The Gudigar community owes its name to the fact that they were originally the hereditary carvers and painters of the temples (gudi).\nL.

The heroine holding a vina is proceeding somewhere and turns to look back at the two blackbuck fawns following her, gently coaxing them to return home.\nGenerally, Ragini Todi is described as a lady attracting deer. A careful study of the painting makes it obvious that the lady is walking away while the fawns follow her. The imagery is reminiscent of the famous scene from Abhijnana Shakuntala where a fawn follows Shakuntala who, on taking leave of the members of the hermitage of Kanva, proceeds towards the kingdom of Bharata. She feeds the tiny one fresh shoots of grass and coaxes it to return. Sangita Damodara, one of the earliest treatises on the iconography of the ragas, datable to the 15th century, visualizes Ragini Todi in a similar manner:\nStanding near a dense forest, fondling the deer with the shoots of lotus,\n\nwith beautiful eyes like half-blown lotus, possessing the complexion of a\n\nlotus garland, she is the Ragini Todi.\nThe term todi connotes parting or breaking in Persian. Traditionally Ragini Todi is also considered to evoke sad feelings. The pain of parting with the daughter after her marriage, so poignantly described by Kalidasa, is an unforgettable experience for every parent. It is possible that musicologists derived the iconography of this raga from this description of Kalidasa. The melody itself may have developed from the songs which are sung at the time of bidding the daughter goodbye. Even today, these songs form a part of the wedding ritual of almost every community in India.\nThe date of the painting was read by Khandalavala himself in the colophon of the set which is now in the Gopikrishna Kanoria collection.\nKarl and Meherbai Khandalavala Collection\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nPaper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nRajasthani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\n1605 CE\nLOCATION\nMewar, Chavand\nDIMENSION\n--","1108":"Sadashiva\nS 63.35\nDESCRIPTION\nSadashiva is considered to be the highest form of Shiva as the supreme being from whom all others have originated.

A famous classic of Persian literature, it consists of five poems: Makhnul Asarar (not dated), Khusru-wa Shirin (1584 CE), Haft Paikar (1584 CE), Laila Majnu (1583 CE), and Sikandar Nama (not dated). Among these, only Haft Paikar is extensively illustrated.\nHaft Paikar is the story of Prince Behram, the son of Yazdegar, King of Persia. He was an expert in the game of hunting and achieved the title Gur \u2013 wild ass \u2013 after killing a fighting lion and wild ass with one arrow. Later he married seven beautiful princesses from different countries. He then ordered his most talented architect Shideh to build a palace for each of the seven princesses. Shideh, true to his abilities, built seven palaces with different coloured domes constructed according to the positions of the planets and their respective colours. Behram decided to visit the princesses one by one according to the day of the week, and requested each of them to tell him a story.\nThe seven stories told by seven princesses reflect seven different stages in the philosophical journey of human life. Behram first visits the princess in the black pavilion, which symbolizes the mystery of God hidden by the veil of ignorance. His journey ends at the palace of Princess Diroste,. which is white, a symbol of divine purity and unity.\nThe colophon pages of the manuscript do not mention the name of the scribe. However, the notes in Persian before the beginning of the second and third masnavi give information about the owner of the book in a later period. It seems that in the mid-17th century this book was in the possession of a Mughal noble who took it with him on the expedition to Kandahar led by Prince Muhammad Aurangzeb. The study of these notes yields very interesting information about the movements of the royal army and the distances covered.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nManuscript Miniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nInk and opaque watercolour on paper\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDeccani\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nAH 992 = 1584 CE\nLOCATION\nDeccani (provenance uncertain)\nDIMENSION\nFolio 21.7 x 16.3 cm, painting 6.1 x 12.5 cm","1112":"Shalabhanjika\nS 110\nDESCRIPTION\nThe Shalabhanjika is a common decorative motif generously depicted in Indian stupa and temple architecture. Common to Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist architecture they are mainly designed as bracket figures.\nThey are often depicted as a well-adorned lady standing gracefully under a stylised tree or grasping the branch of a tree. She may also be shown engaged in different activities like dancing, playing a musical instrument, or adorning herself with cosmetics and jewellery. They are known as Madanikas, Surasundaris, or Devanganas in ancient and medieval Indian Shilpa texts. These celestial beauties were all-time favourites of Sanskrit and Prakrit poets and playwriters. Often their nayikas (heroines) were associated with these themes; for e.g., Rajasekhara's 'Viddhashalabhanjika' and 'Karpuramanjari'\nThey are symbols of fertility and nourishment which can be deduced upon observing the efforts taken to carve their hips and breasts. The Yakshi (tree nymph) sculptures may be considered a prototype for them.\nHere, a well adorned young lady stands under stylised tree in full bloom. Her sharp features are finely delineated; particularly interesting are her arched eyebrows and firm yet delicate chin. Her nose must have been well shaped once.

It is one of the most celebrated of all antiquities. It is not entirely in its original form and was almost certainly made as an amphora with a pointed base, probably broken in antiquity and repaired with an unrelated cameo disc. The subject of the reliefs has never been definitively explained and many interpretations have been proposed.\nIts fame in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, is due to the brilliant series of copies made in black jasper ware by Josiah Wedgwood (1730\u201395) after he was lent the original by the 3rd Duke of Portland in 1786. Wedgwood was one of the most innovative figures in the history of English ceramics. His many experiments with different kinds of bodies and glazes led to the perfection, around 1771, of a high-fired stoneware which he called \u201cJasper\u201d. This was the material used for his Portland Vase copies. The subtlety of the original reliefs proved difficult to replicate, however, and the first successful copies date from 1789. The Wedgwood Company produced many copies of the vase and dating this one is not easy. It must date from before 1860, however, when the factory introduced a three-letter dating system. The inclusion of the Paris cameo under the base may suggest a date before 1845 when the British Museum detached it from the body and displayed it separately.\nSir DJ Tata Collection\nCOLLECTION\nEuropean Decorative Art\nARTIST\nJosiah Wedgwood\nOBJECT TYPE\nVase\nMATERIAL\nJasperware; Wedgwood\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nEnglish\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nLate 19th century CE\nLOCATION\nEngland\nDIMENSION\n--","1114":"Chanda talking to a Friend\n57.1\/22\nDESCRIPTION\nFolio from an illustrated manuscript of Chandayana.\nChandayana is a folk love story of the Ahirs of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which, was versified by Maullana Daud, a Sufi saint, and poet in circa 1377 CE.

As the paintings were mainly commissioned by the British Company officials, they are known as Company School paintings.\nMica is a transparent material made of potassium silicates, found in South India as well as in parts of Bihar. As a painting medium, the thin sheets of mica are painted using gouache. Its smooth structure does not let the paint sink in and the colours applied to it appear exceptionally bright. Due to the highly smooth surface of mica, it became essential for the artists to use a binding medium with the colours to create these works. In a few of the paintings, colour has been applied to both the front and the back surfaces of the sheet\u2014to enhance the opacity of the pigment. This approach makes the paintings appear three-dimensional.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Miniature Paintings\nOBJECT TYPE\nMiniature Painting\nMATERIAL\nWatercolour on Mica\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nMica painting\nTECHNIQUE\nMica painting\nDATE\n19th century CE\nLOCATION\nSouth India\nDIMENSION\n--","1137":"Netsuke of a skeleton with a mallet\n22.1753\nDESCRIPTION\nHalloween is an annual holiday celebrated each year on October 31. It originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honour all saints - All Saints Day; which then incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes, eating sweet treats and divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror films.\nThe Japanese have many wild and wonderful legends of ghostly beings, known as Yokai, and one of the most malevolent of them all is the Gashadokuro.

A century later photographs replaced both as a more reliable visual record. After 1770, professional artists began to visit India and observe the country through the eyes of British taste. They made oil paintings for local British residents, as well as drawings, which could later be worked up in England into engravings. Suddenly the market had numerous copies of the same subject.\nAfter the Anglo-Maratha war, the British residents started taking interest in western India.

The term \u201cdamascening\u201d is derived from the name of the ancient city of Damascus in Syria where it originated. It reached India during the Mughal period, probably through Iran and Afghanistan. Initially, this technique was used mainly to decorate hilts of daggers, swords, and shields. However, later it was also used to embellish articles of daily use like boxes, huqqa bases, vases, trays, etc. Metal objects, especially those of steel or iron, were embellished using the damascening technique. The art is practised in many countries though there are variations in the decoration from region to region. It is the art of decorating one metal with encrusted designs in another metal, usually gold or silver. A laborious technique is to cut grooves in the surface of the base metal, to receive thin gold leaf or wire which is hammered carefully into the incised pattern. In another technique, gold leaf or wire is inlaid or applied to a surface that has been prepared by crosshatching or chasing with a sharp tool. This work is a bit superficial compared to the former technique.

She is worshipped in both benevolent and ferocious form and known by various names like Uma, Gauri, Parvati, Jagadamba, Bhairavi, Durga, Kali, Chandi, Bhavani, Chamunda and so on. Her worship symbolizes the acceptance of female energy.\nSince prehistoric times female energy is worshipped as a giver of life and fertility. Indus Valley sites (2600- 1900 BCE) have yielded a large number of female clay figurines which are probably of mother goddesses.\nDuring the Gupta period (320- 647 CE) the worship of the Great Goddesses gained popularity. By this time the text- 'Devi Mahatmya' glorifying Devi was composed. Devi Mahatmya considers that Devi represents all three aspects \u2013 Prakriti (creation), Maya (illusion) and shakti (power). She creates, pervades and sustains the Universe. Shakti here is not a consort of male deity but rather she is a universal phenomenon, the sole reality.\nThe goddess is worshipped in her benign (Saumya) and ferocious (Ugra) forms. In her ferocious form, she is the slayer of demons like Madhu-Kaitabh, Mahishasura, Shumbha, Nishumbha. She has several manifestations that are dreadful, dangerous and bloodthirsty.\nGift of Smt.

It is a typical creation of the weavers of Maharashtra and its peculiarity lies in the use of an interlocking technique to create borders and designs in highly contrasting colours.\nLike several other regional styles of weaving, Paithani is also a family-based craft passing from generation to generation. Minute minakari designs in the pallu using various colours is woven with the help of multiple spindles (tillies), which makes it a very laborious and complicated task. Paithani textiles mainly consist of sari, pugdi piece, dhoti and dupatta, out of which, the sari of course is the most elaborate. The sari generally has brocade borders and a big golden pallu with colourful floral and other designs. Occasionally, the ground is decorated with fine buties in gold. The pallu is richly decorated with a variety of motifs like asavali, akroti, bangdimor, Ajanta lotus and huma parinda. Some of the saris have a coin motif known as ashrafi spread all over the fabric.\nThe ruling families of the Peshwas particularly patronised Paithani. Their fondness for Paithani is reflected in many of the letters ordering dhotis, dupattas, turbans etc. in different varieties and colours. Documents show their preference for plain dhoti with silver and gold thread work, turbans in green and dupatta having asavali or narali work in red, pink, orange and green. Besides Paithan, many other regional centres began to weave Paithani. Yeola, one such centre became famous for its mango designs. Paithani was not only popular with the Marathas but it also attracted the Nizam of Hyderabad and his family who had visited the Paithani centre several times. His daughter-in-law Begum Nilofar even introduced new motifs to the border as we as pallu designs.\nTraditionally known as Jambhul Rang Paithani, this purple Paithani originally belonged to the Nizam family as reported by the collector herself. It has nearly woven Jai Phul (Jasmine) jari butis all over which are closely spaced near the pallu. The broad borders are done in narali pattern. On the ground near the pallu there are eight guldasta butis in the shape of mango and a diaper of cartouches containing flowers done in a silver jari. A beautiful interplay of gold and silver is seen in the silver mango motifs on the golden pallu.

His hands are joined against his chest in the classic Indian gesture of greeting and devotion. He wears a dhoti with a broad belt and several hanging ornaments over his garment that create a pleasing rhythmic pattern.

The faithful Hanuman is seen washing Rama's feet. The setting is the palace of a Hill raja in the architectural fashion of the second half of the 18th century. Sita and her maidens are all Pahari ladies and Rama is a Pahari chief, save that he wears a crown instead of a turban. Rama's face is painted blue because he, like Krishna, is an incarnation of the God Vishnu, whose, colour is always blue. The long forest exile is over and Sita has been rescued from Ravana.\nTo those familiar with the epic, the feeling of joyous reunion, subtly suggested in the faces of Rama and his consort, will be apparent. The artist's interpretation of the undisturbed happiness which Rama and Sita were not to enjoy for long, is undeniably sensitive. There is a sense of isolation which is suggested by the battlemented walls that shut out the palace from the outer world. The royal couple seems so far away from the whispered rumours of evil tongues, which are to end their newfound bliss. Here in the company of a few adoring handmaidens and the ever-faithful Hanuman, there is peace and rest and soft music after the long travail. The maiden in the middle of the group to the right holds Rama's bow and quiver of arrows. They are a reminder of the days in the forest and the struggle against Ravana. Rama also wears a flower garland. Comic relief is afforded by Hanuman who glances up at the girl playing the drum as if he does not approve of her performance. The Indian artist was always most successful in humanizing Hanuman's monkey form.\nThe curtain, partly rolled up, at the top of the picture, is a common device borrowed from Mughal painting, while the doorkeeper standing in the distant entrance-arch, is another favourite Mughal clich\u00e9 derived from Persian miniatures. The workmanship of this painting is of high excellence, particularly the faces of Rama and Sita, which are in Kangra kalam and have a delicate porcelain-like finish, which the colour reproduction fails to convey. Airy pavilions of white or pink stone and semicircular arches supported by elegant pillars were greatly in fashion. Silver was used for woven and painted textiles, huqqas, and other objects. It was also used to depict water and lotuses. Silver tarnishes after a time and in consequence, it is always seen as a metallic grey-black wherever it appears in Pahari paintings. The cushions in the painting are an instance in point. The mount surrounding the miniature is pink with close hatching of short strokes in a darker pink.\nThough ascribed to Mandi, women with similar features are also found in paintings from Guler and Chamba, and this painting could equally well be assigned to Guler. Roerich acquired a similar painting stated to be the work of a Mandi artist; hence, the Mandi attribution.

There are diverse opinions regarding the origin of the art. According to some scholars it originated in China while some ascribe its origin to India and Java. Popularly it is known as the Javanese art of wax printing. The design is created by the resist dyeing process using wax as the resist, which retains the original fabric colour in the patterns, after dyeing the material. It was forgotten in our country till the University of Shantiniketan revived the art around 1923. Pratima Tagore learned this Batik technique in Paris and started the workshops at Shantiniketan.\nThe present sari is a unique example of Batik specially designed sometime around 1940 by Nandalal Bose, a renowned artist of the Bengal School, for a performance to be staged in front of Gurudev Tagore. Gauri, the daughter of Nandababu, executed it in Batik. The sari is designed on motia or off-white fine silk and the patterns were drawn with brush and tjanting method in which a copper vessel filled with hot wax is used. A gentle flow of wax is maintained through the spout to draw a freehand design. The brown silk sari has bold floral creeper designs on the pallu, border, and in the centre where it is to be pleated into multiple folds.\nThe sari was worn by Sushila Asher while performing the famous dance drama Shyama as well as Natir puja in 1940, in the presence of Gurudev Tagore.\nCOLLECTION\nTextiles and Costumes of India\nOBJECT TYPE\nSari\nMATERIAL\nSilk\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\nBatik\nDATE\n1935-1939 CE\nLOCATION\nShantiniketan\nDIMENSION\n490 x 114 cms","1176":"Garudadipa\n33.725\nDESCRIPTION\nSir D.

He wears a mukuta (crown) with a serpant, earrings, necklace, armbands, kadas (bangles), and yajnopavita (sacred thread), and has the typical U-shaped Vaishnava tilaka on his forehead and similar marks on his body. He is shown subduing a Naga with his left knee.

The lamp is in the form of a padma (lotus) which is also one of the attributes of Vishnu. Interestingly the lamp can be opened and closed as required. When not in use, the form presented is that of a lotus bud, but unscrewing the bud to use the lamp the fuel receptacle appears as a round bowl forming the centre of a full-bloomed lotus.\nThe practice of using animal and bird figures for lamps and other ritual objects is common in India. This is probably because the vahana which is favourite of a particular deity is a suitable medium for conveying a devotee\u2019s gift or offering to the god.

As early as 400 B.C. Bhasa the great dramatist presents Raas dance associated with the Bhagavata cult. There is a mention in the Bhagavata Purana where Krishna says that \u201cMy stories should be sung, danced and enacted on festive occasions\u201d (XI.27.44).\nPhilosophically the most important dance of Krishna is the Raasmandala (Raas Lila) meaning circle of delight or ecstasy. The love of Krishna and the gopis takes place in a circle that has no beginning nor an end and goes on and on for eternity. In the Vaishnava cult, this mystic dance has a special ritualistic significance.\nDashma Skanda of Bhagavata Purana describes the Raas Lila of Krishna. With a desire to sport with gopis on a full moon night of Sharada Ritu (October-November), Krishna invites gopis by playing melodious music on his flute. Enchanted by the music, gopis rush to him and Krishna starts dancing and sporting with them amorously. On receiving Krishna\u2019s favour gopis feel immense pride. Realizing this, Krishna disappears from the scene and comes back only on the repeated pleading of the gopis and plays maharass with them. With his divine power, he multiplies himself and dances with all the gopis and simultaneously. He thus convinces them that he participates in their lives, giving freely of himself to each and everyone and ensuring that he is lovingly and completely available to his devotees. The dance leads the gopis to the path of liberation where the individual soul jivatman joins the divine soul parmatman.\nThere is a long tradition of circular dance in India. The earliest reference of a circular dance is in the Harivansha Purana (5th century A.D.). The dance is referred to here as \u2018Hallishaka\u2019 where many women dance in a circle around one man. In Indian Philosophy a circle has many symbolic connotations.\nSvetastara Upanishada says:\n\u201cThis Universe is a wheel\nUpon it are all creatures that are subject to\nBirth, death, and rebirth\nRound and round it turns\nAnd never stops\u201d.\nThe Tradition of raas dance still continues.\nKrishna through Yogamaya became many so that he could give his love to all. He was like a sapphire in a necklace of gold. There was such harmony of ragas and raginis that hearing it, water and wind no longer flowed. The moon together with the starry sky being astonished rained down nectar with its rays. The wives of Gods gathered in the sky. Meanwhile, night advanced and six months had passed.

In some part of India there is practice of gifting Dipa Lakshmi on elephant to newly wed daughters at festival time to bestow prosperity and fertility on her.\nOne of the most important milestones in the history of mankind is the discovery of fire. It has played a very crucial role in the progress and development of man and therefore, in India, fire and lamps are considered very auspicious.\nIn earlier times, lamps were perhaps only wicks lit in hollows or shallow depressions in stone. Later on, lamps were made of sea shells, clay and various metals like brass, copper and silver. In the \u2018Ramayana\u2019 and the \u2018Mahabharata\u2019 there are references to lamps made of gold. The earliest lamp was simple - a small bowl made of clay with a beak-like projection, popularly known as Panti. Interestingly, this type of lamp is found in India as early as the Harappan period (3300 BCE to 1800 BCE) and continues till this date!\nIn India, lamp symbolizes the human body and flame symbolizes the soul. Thus the individual is a Deepak (lamp) and the soul is a jeevan jyoti (the flame of life). Indians believe, that the soul is immortal. Even after the death of a person, a lamp is lit to guide the departing soul into the other world.\nAt every stage of life therefore, lamps are lit to celebrate the eternal life force. In earlier times special lamps were lit at coronation ceremonies, on the return of a victorious warrior and at every other important occasion. The aarti (ritualistic adoration with lighted lamps) is performed even today to strengthen and establish relationship between man and God, brother and sister, wife and husband, mother and child. Ancient texts mention Deepadaan (gifting of lamp) as a act of high merit. There are several festivals connected with lamps \u2013 Deep Amavasya (July \u2013 August), Diwali (October \u2013 November) and Ganga poojan which are celebrated with great pomp.\nWith the passage of time there has been innovation in the types and shapes of lamps meant for different occasions and requirement.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection.\nCOLLECTION\nIndian Decorative Art\nOBJECT TYPE\nLamp\nMATERIAL\nBrass\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\n--\nTECHNIQUE\n--\nDATE\nEarly 20th Century CE\nLOCATION\n--\nDIMENSION\n--","1181":"Meeting of Rama and Parashurama\n54.1\/19\nDESCRIPTION\nIllustrated folio from the set of Mewar Ramayana\nThe Museum acquired nineteen folios of a dispersed Ramayana set painted during the patronage of Maharana Jagat Singh I (1628-52 CE), whose atelier was crowned by two great artists: Sahebdin and Manohar.

It is found in South and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The great hornbill is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.

This richly illustrated manuscript was commissioned by Emperor Akbar - the great Mughal ruler.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, this manuscript was in the library of the Honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone in Poona which caught fire. This manuscript consisting of over two hundred illustrations, was saved and though badly damaged, some art lover retrieved the less damaged folios by mounting them on a uniform size paper which were bound in an album form. Sir Alma Latifi, a member of the Indian Civil Service, purchased this album at a sale of Sotheby\u2019s in London in 1938, and it was bequeathed to the Museum in 1973 by the family. A few loose folios of the manuscript have dispersed. Not a single folio has remained intact. However, the artistic quality of the surviving 231 paintings, some of which are mere tidbits, suggests a well-planned and organised production under the supervision of a master artist, who in all probability could be Abd-al Samad.\nThe manuscript can be considered a landmark in the naturalistic and masterly studies of animals and birds. A whole world of animals and birds unfolds before us as they are seen running and chasing, holding assemblies and consultations, conspiring against others and even participating in human affairs. The Mughal style is seen completely liberated from the Persian idiom and has achieved an identity of its own as a naturalistic painting.\nThere is no doubt that a large number of real study drawings must have been made by the artists to portray them so effectively and realistically, in varied actions and moods. In that respect, the manuscript is an original creation of the Mughal atelier revealed considerable imagination in the rendering and composition of the paintings.\nGift of Smt.

The story goes that Rishabhanatha left the kingdom to his son Bharata, who in order to become a Chakravartin (a sovereign), had to overpower his brother, Bahubali in a public duel. Bahubali, as the name suggests, had a powerful physique and arms of steel. He lifted Bharata and flung him to the ground twice. As he was about to do it the third time, wisdom dawned and he realized the futility of worldly power. He gently put down his brother, and went away to the forest in search of Truth. He performed such severe austerities that ant-hills grew around him and creepers wound round his legs and spread all over his body.\nThe modelling of this exquisite bronze figure is the work of a great artist.

Only an artist like Chokha1 who excelled in recreating the atmosphere and the mood of the moment in his paintings could capture such a scene. He has subtly used shades of black and grey, and the technique of heavy stippling and fine lines to enhance the body contours of the elephant. Chokha was fond of using black in his paintings as seen in his \u201cMother and Child\u201d in the collection of Alvin O. Bellak.\nAll four legs of the elephant are heavily chained, making it impossible for him to free even one of them. The person standing in front of him is trying to control him with firecrackers. The people working around appear tiny insignificant creatures in front of the mad, but a majestic elephant. The white tusks against the dark background emphasize his fierceness. The shimmering metal chains glow in the light of the firecrackers thrown at him. The dark sky is dotted with tiny, glittering stars. The artist has emphasized the pinkish swollen gland between the ear and the eye of the elephant to suggest his state of musth which generally occurs in the winter months from November to January.\nChokha was the son of the artist Bagta who worked for Maharana Ari Singh at Udaipur in the 1760s, and later for the Rawats of Deogarh circa 1790\u20131811.

It is possible that originally as the name indicates, the backdrop illustrated a small tree (chod) symbolising the tree under which the Tirthankara attained enlightenment.\nJari embroidery was a much-developed craft and there are about thirteen different varieties of material used for this kind of embroidery, which was generally done on velvet or on heavy silk. These materials are known as Surma, Jhik, Tiki, Tas, Tui, Badla, Kasab and Kangani. They are made out of wire or flat strips of silver.

It takes its name from the city of Bidar in the Deccan where it originated. It was used for a wide variety of everyday articles like pandan (savoury box), surahi (wine flask), huqqa (hubble bubble), etc. The base metal of Bidri is an alloy of zinc, copper and lead on which elaborate inlay is done. Fine wires, as well as pieces of silver, brass and occasionally gold, are inlaid in grooves etched upon the surface of the article which is darkened with chemical treatment, creating a pleasant contrast between the design and ground areas. Popular designs are floral or geometrical patterns and also include motifs like the Swastika - an auspicious symbol in India, the Fish - a royal emblem of Oudh Nawabs, and the Mahipusht - fish scale pattern.\nThis surahi features an alternating pattern of a pair of fish and vine creepers. It is decorated with the \u2018zar-buland\u2019 technique where the metal is laid over a lead pad to provide high relief. Inlay of silver, brass, and copper is common in bidri ware.

He was born c. 1597 in The Hague; he travelled to Milan and crossed the Alps in 1614 in the company of the Utrecht artist Terbrugghen; by 1629, after a stay in Amsterdam, he settled in The Hague where, in 1636, he received permission to hold an auction. Thereafter he is unmentioned in documents. The latest known date on a work by him is 1665. In his treatise of 1678, Samuel van Hoogstraten relates that Knibbergen, Jan van Goyen, and Jan Porcellis competed to see who could paint the best landscape in a single day (Knibbergen\u2019s was the largest and depicted mountains, trees, and \u201cdashing\u201d waterfalls) and that Porcellis won.\nKnibbergen\u2019s landscapes appear occasionally at the auction but are uncommon in museums; some are signed; only a few are dated. For the most part, they reflect van Goyen\u2019s style and predilection to paint scenes of dunes and rivers. This rare dated example (1630) is of particular importance because it records Knibbergen\u2019s pre-van Goyen style, albeit less Italianate than a presumably still earlier, signed landscape sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 1995. It has been suggested that the small, well-dressed figures and hunch-backed beggar in the foreground of the Tata panel were painted by another artist active in The Hague, Esaias van de Velde, who, like Knibbergen, absorbed elements of Flemish Forest scenes by Gillis van Conixloo and especially David Vinckboons.\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nEuropean Paintings\nARTIST\nKnibbergen\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on Panel\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nDutch\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n17th Century CE\nLOCATION\nThe Netherlands\nDIMENSION\n--","1242":"Lady on Horseback\n22.4595\nDESCRIPTION\nSir Ratan Tata Art Collection\nCOLLECTION\nEuropean Paintings\nARTIST\nSir Alfred James Munnings\nOBJECT TYPE\nOil Painting\nMATERIAL\nOil on Canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBritish\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n1878 \u2013 1959\nLOCATION\nUnited Kingdom\nDIMENSION\n--","1243":"Bohemian Gypsies\n22.4581\nDESCRIPTION\nThis painting is a boisterous and colourful narrative about the nomadic race.

The troupe has travelled a long distance and is now settling down for the night. It is a large group, and some are seen still coming towards the spot, riding on mules, bearing various kinds of goods. Notice that the painting depicts a range of characters, activities and moods, right from childhood to old age.\nDaniel Maclise (1806-70) was a leading history painter of his time. He was Irish but worked out of London. In 1829, he exhibited for the first time in the Royal Academy. He was also a caricaturist and is noted for his character portraits. He designed illustrations for several of Dickens\u2019 books and other works. He was commissioned in 1846to paint murals in the House of Lords on such subjects as Justice and Chivalry.

Here, the female nude symbolizes ideal beauty. We see a soldier wrapped with a spellbound look; an artist kissing her hand with respect; a poet with a raised hand holding a book, probably indicating some verses written in praise; and a gentleman looking at her with interest: all expressions to convey admiration for beauty. The fruits and silverware are gifts that indicate adoration. Rapid brushwork, bright colours and the stark contrast between the figures in the foreground and background is a characteristic feature of this painting.\nWilliam Strang (1859-1921) was born at Dumbarton and moved to London when he was sixteen. There he studied art at the Slade School for six years. By the mid-1890s, he had an international reputation as an artist. At first, he concentrated on imaginary allegorical scenes in a pseudo-Venetian manner influenced by his friends, Ricketts and Shannon. Strang produced several paintings, portraits, nude figures in landscapes, and groups of peasant families, which were exhibited at the Royal Academy, the International Society and several German exhibitions. He was one of the original members of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and his work was a part of their first exhibition in 1881.\nSir Ratan Tata Collection\nCOLLECTION\nEuropean Paintings\nARTIST\nWilliam Strang\nOBJECT TYPE\nPainting\nMATERIAL\nOil on Canvas\nSCHOOLS\/CULTURE\/PERIOD\nBritish\nTECHNIQUE\nOil painting\nDATE\n1913 CE\nLOCATION\nUnited Kingdom\nDIMENSION\n--","1245":"Vase and Cover\n33.1107\nDESCRIPTION\nThe tall vase is of two-handled \u201cwater drop\u201d form, with bulbous lower part and long, slender neck. It has a circular foot and stands on a separate stepped plinth, modelled with multiple scrolls, beading, and other motifs. The body is decorated in relief with gilded foliage on a red ground, the rising scroll handles have triangular pierced panels of foliage at their bases, and the neck is modelled with openwork scrolls below the domed ogee cover.\nThe Royal Crown Derby porcelain factory was founded in 1876 as the Derby Crown Porcelain Company and changed its name following a visit by Queen Victoria in 1890. Like Worcester, Derby had been an important centre of the English china industry since the middle of the 18th century and Royal Crown Derby traced its origins to the factory established in about 1756 by William Duesbury.\nThe late 19th-century company was particularly known for its display wares. This particular vase, apparently a previously unrecorded shape, is a technical tour de force and typical of the eclecticism of its age. It is extremely thinly constructed, and its plinth is entirely separate. The design is a combination of influences from many different sources. The form of the vase and its high, openwork scroll handles combine elements of gothic revival and Islamic metalwork, while the red body with gilt flowers in more than one colour of gilding is inspired by Japanese lacquer, then extremely sought after in Europe.\nSir D.J.

The tall bodies are of slightly tapering cylindrical form and are divided into three panels, each with a male figure in a landscape, modelled in relief, and with impressed quatrefoil motifs above. Each panel is separated by a grotesque winged creature in relief at the base, a horned mask below the lip, and a garland of foliage between. The broad lip is modelled with further motifs and the angular scroll handle with beaded and serrated ornament.\nThese imposing flagons are revivals of a type of pouring vessel made in Germany during the 16th and early 17th centuries. Stoneware (so-called because it is fired at a higher temperature than most pottery and is much harder) was produced on an industrial scale and plain utilitarian pots were exported all over Europe. More elaborate and costly wares with fine incised and relief decoration were also made, especially at the potteries of Siegburg and Westerwald, southeast of Cologne.\nDecorated stoneware of the 16th century enjoyed a revival of interest among 19th century collectors and changed hands for high prices in the later part of the century. At the same time an enthusiasm for a patriotic \u201calt deutsch\u201d style in German manufactured goods followed the unification of the Reich in 1871. With official government support, production of Westerwald stoneware in traditional styles was revived and promoted at international exhibitions. Highly original historicist wares from the 1870s onwards are particularly associated with the firms of Merkelbach und Wick and Reinhold Hanke.\nThe Tata flagons are not signed or marked (other than an incised number, see below) but were possibly made by one or other of these firms. They reflect this renewed antiquarian interest and draw extensively on Renaissance ornament. But they are far from exact copies. The standing figures are dressed in the type of costume seen in early 16th-century portraits by Cranach and his contemporaries; the horned masks on the upper bodies recall elaborate helmets in 16th-century parade armours, and the serrated ornament on the outer face of the handles seems to relate to the kind of silver straps sometimes made to mount such vessels.\nThe two flagons, although very similar, are not an exact pair and there are a number of small differences between them: one has holes on the handle for a mount, the other does not; one is slightly greyer than the other, and one has a band of laurel beneath the lip while the other has egg-and-dart. One of the two is impressed under the base (before firing) with the number 599.\nSir D.J.

The hamsa then sings in praise of the beautiful maiden Damayanti to Nala. The hamsa promises Nala that he will praise the Raja in the presence of Damayanti. So the hamsa goes to Damayanti\u2019s place and praises Raja Nala in such a manner that she confesses to having fallen in love with him.\nFigurines such as this object seem to be modelled after lithographs made in Germany in the 19th century on Indian subjects.\nGift of Smt.

Bells and chimes once played an important musical role in the court rituals of the Qing dynasty.\nThe qing, identical front, and back, is decorated with a gold lacquer painting of two imperial five-clawed dragons contending for the flaming pearl among clouds.
